-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Here is how I gather the timing attack against RSA decryption would
work.  This is the chosen-ciphertext attack of Paul Kocher's.

You know n, the public modulus; suppose it is 512 bits.  You want to
know p and q, its prime factors.  You know the details of the server's
implementation of RSA.  The server will do a decryption of the RSA
message you send it, and give you some reply shortly after it is
finished.

You are going to send it bogus messages.  Normally, most random
messages will encrypt under RSA to numbers of about 512 bits, but you will
send it ciphertext which is about 256 bits long.  You are going to try
to figure out the value of p.

The server's algorithm is to take the ciphertext c, and first do:

cp = c mod p
cq = c mod q

It will then do two modular exponentiations, mod p and mod q, and do a
few more calculations, then return some result to you.

The attack is to try to choose c to be about the same size as p, with the
assumption being that if c is a bit less than p then c mod p will be fast
since it doesn't have to do anything, while if c is somewhat larger than
p then c mod p will be a little slower, since it will have to at least
subtract p from c.  Paul Kocher has measured this timing difference as 17
microseconds on one particular implementation.

This is not going to be an easy time difference to measure.  In
addition to doing the c mod p step, the algorithm also does all those
other things:  the c mod q, the two RSA calculations, as well as
whatever overhead is involved in the server's operation and the
communication link.  The variations due to the RSA calculations
themselves will have a standard deviation of about 250 microseconds,
based on Paul's numbers (higher than his reported value because two
exponentiations are done, plus some other work).  So this is a minimum
amount of "noise" we must try to see through even if everything else is
instantaneous.  This might be the situation in the case of a hardwware
token which is doing RSA decryptions with a secret key.

The first step will be to try to determine the length of p.  For this
we will send in c values which are around 256 bits long.  We might
start with some 250 bit values and some 260 bit values, hoping that p
is in that range.  We do a whole lot of these, and we take the average
time for them.  If p is between 250 and 260 bits long, then the 260 bit
values should take at least 17 microseconds more time to calculate on
the average than the 250 bit values.

One interesting question is how many samples we would have to take in
order to detect this difference.  One way to consider it is to ask,
given that the samples have a standard deviation of about 250
microseconds, how many samples do we have to take to reliably estimate
the mean within an accuracy of about 10 microseconds, or 1/25 of a
standard deviation?

According to my limited knowledge of statistics, if we want to be right
about 90% or 95% of the time, we need to have sqrt(number-of-samples) *
1/25 be &gt; 3, or number-of-samples should be about 5000.  (Take this
with a large grain of salt!)  So we will have to do some thousands of
samples in order to average out the noise and get our mean this
accurate, with good confidence.

Once we have done these tests, we have determined that p is between our
two values.  Now we can sub-divide the interval and poll with values
which are, say, 255 bits long.  Again, we would have to do enough polls
to determine the true mean time to within about 10 microseconds.

After we repeat this three or four times, we will know the bit length
of p; in effect, we know its first bit.  Now we can continue the
divide and bracket procedure.  Each time, we must poll many times with
c values whose most significant bits are halfway between the two
bracketing values which we know contain p.  Each such sequence of about
5000 polls yields us one more bit of p.

We repeat this about 250 times, and we will have p, from which we can
derive q, and we have broken the RSA key.  So, taking the estimate
above of 5000 or so samples to get a bit of p, we will have to do about
a million tests total to find p.  (BTW, in Paul's implementation it
took about 1/3 second to do a decryption, so you're looking at about
100 days of solid work to do the job.)

This algorithm has some self-correcting features but it is not
completely so.  Suppose p's first bits are actually 1011.  We have
determined that it is between 1000 and 1100, and we want the 3rd bit.
We poll with values which start with 1010, and (since with 90% accuracy
we are wrong 10% of the time) we mistakenly conclude that the mean is
the higher value, hence that p is less than 1010 and must start as
100X.  We continue the procedure, and we will find that our new middle
values are consistently less than p, so we gradually work out our
estimate as 10011111...  Eventually this train of 1's might persuade us
that we may have made a mistake back there, so we would go back and
poll again to try to verify our earlier results.  (Of course, if
another mistake happens during the 1's that will confuse us further...)

Doing the attack across a network will be much more difficult because
there will be a lot more variation in the turnaround time.  This will
have the effect of increasing the standard deviation far above a
quarter millisecond, up by probably at least an order of magnitude if
not two or more.  Now we have to estimate a mean to within not 1/25,
but maybe 1/1000 of a standard deviation, or worse.  This would
increase the total number of samples necessary from a million up to the
level of billions or trillions.

One final note: two cases to which we might want to apply this would be
Netscape's SSL as implemented by its secure servers, and DigiCash's
bank software.  (I know Lucky said that DigiCash is immune to this
attack, but maybe we would want to test it to see.) In either case,
since we are sending a bogus 256 bit value, the data which decrypts
will not be valid.  In the case of SSL we will probably get an error
packet or maybe a broken connection to tell us when it has finished the
decryption.  In the case of DigiCash, it does not need to do anything
with the value it signs other than return it, so we will probably get a
return packet.  However, it is not valid cash.  In order to convince
DigiCash to send us this packet, it has to have deducted something from
our account, at least a penny.  If it takes a billion connections to do
the attack (which I think is an underestimate, corresponding to about a
10 millisecond standard deviation on the timing values), that will cost
10 million dollars.  So you better have pretty deep pockets to think
about mounting this attack in that case.  For SSL, misses don't cost you
anything, so maybe it would be worth trying, if you have a good,
low-latency connection and a server with a light load.  The full attack
would take too long but just determining the length of p would be quite a
coup.

Actually of course you would have to do some more research before
mounting this attack; specifically, you'd want to know more about the
timing of the software so you could estimate the costs of the mod p
operation you are trying to catch.  If the number ends up being much less
than 17 microseconds the attack gets that much harder.

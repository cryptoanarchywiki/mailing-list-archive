The recent WHITE HOT interest by multiple groups and individuals in the 

                 CYBERANARCHIST TENTACLE INFILTRATIONS

into the Internet have inspired an EXCITING NEW CONTEST and COMPETITION!

we, the Federation of Associations of Cyberspace Everywhere (FACE), 
announce the 

        SUPREMELY QUACKY UNIFIED INTERNET SNAKE HUNT! (SQUISH)


          * THOUSANDS OF CONTESTANTS * HUGE CASH PRIZES *
         * FASCINATING DISCOVERIES * HEDONISTIC DELIGHTS * 
       * FANTASTIC FUN FOR EVERYONE * FAMOUS PARTICIPANTS *

OBJECT OF SQUISH

  the OBJECT of SQUISH is to find TENTACLES and SNAKES.  A TENTACLE is
  an email address used by a real person for the purpose of
  concealing their identity from others. A SNAKE is a TENTACLE that
  is particularly wicked and evil and will lie and trick others into
  believing the TENTACLE is real. In words, the more consequential
  and malicious a TENTACLE, the more it is a SNAKE.

  Different points are awarded for playing. Anyone who can send mail
  can play! The simplest and cheapest points come from sending email
  to suspected  SNAKES and TENTACLES, and chalking up points
  depending on the responses. Larger points are awarded for `real
  world' interactions such as calling  suspected tentacles and snakes
  at their telephone numbers. 

  When a snake or tentacle gets upset in response to mail, it is said
  to be QUIVERING. It will go through CONTORTIONS to convince you to
  leave it alone and may begin to SQUIRM if you persist. When people
  are not writing through fake email addresses, they are said to be
  using their TRUE NAME. TRUE NAMES may go through quivering,
  contortions, and squirming too. Sometimes snakes or tentacles may
  threaten to stop using an email account entirely. 
  
  Some of the TRUE NAMES are BIG MACS and some are SMALL FRIES. Much
  larger points are awarded for exposing the BIG MACS, but some
  points are available for SMALL FRIES. BIG MACS are famous people on
  the Internet-- people that no one would expect have snakes and
  tentacles, or have media stories written about them. Massive points
  are awarded for BIG MAC exposures.

  Matches take place in Cyberspace on the PLAYFIELD, with different
  regions consisting of INFECTED OUTLETS, CRIME SCENES, and KILLING
  FIELDS. A KILLING FIELD is a place where a tentacle and a player
  compete or a Big Mac is assaulted. INFECTED OUTLETS are media
  outlets or journals that carry BIG MAC propaganda, disinformation,
  or lies. A CRIME SCENE is a place where provably illegal activity
  takes place, e.g. someone passes a bribe. 

  The grand point prizes go to anyone who can expose MEDUSA. MEDUSA is
  the leader of all SMALL FRIES and BIG MACS, a wicked, evil
  incarnation of SATAN on the Internet. She is the originator and
  chief proseletyzer of the art, science, and religion of lies.
  MEDUSA has dozens of SNAKES  all over the Internet, particularly in
  extremely sensitive areas such as Internet protocol development
  (e.g. mercantile or digital cash protocols), posting from public
  access sites and even `covers' and `front' sites, these are called
  POISON NEEDLES. Corrupt administrators are always either BIG MACS
  or SMALL FRIES. Some sites have administrators who are unaware or
  apathetic toward infiltrations, these are called PAWNS.
  
  MEDUSA is the orchestrator of a MASSIVE INTERNATIONAL CONSPIRACY to
  STRANGLE, SABOTAGE, and POISON THE INTERNET. Anyone who can drive
  MEDUSA and all the corrupt BIG MACS from Cyberspace and the real
  world forever is called THE SAVIOR and said to have DRIVEN THE
  PHARISEES FROM THE TEMPLE. However, the player must avoid being
  CRUCIFIED or the cash award will not be given.

  POINTS can be traded in for COLD CASH. The first person with more
  than  500 points gets A DOLLAR PER POINT (some restrictions apply,
  not valid in all areas, void where prohibited by law, taxes may
  vary).


          * THOUSANDS OF CONTESTANTS * HUGE CASH PRIZES *
         * FASCINATING DISCOVERIES * HEDONISTIC DELIGHTS * 
     * FANTASTIC FUN FOR EVERYONE * MYSTERIES OF THE UNKNOWN *

SQUISH DIRECTIONS

1. Consult the list of SUSPECTED SMALL FRIES, BIG MACS, SNAKES,
  TENTACLES, MEDUSA &amp; SISTERS, and POISON NEEDLES below. Send mail to
  any attempting to discover whether they are real or fake, or have
  knowledge of other BIG MACS or even MEDUSA. 

2. When you get CONTORTIONS or SQUIRMS, or mount COUNTERMEASURES,
  keep track of your all your points in a file. Ratings are listed
  under RATINGS below. List the persons and email addresses involved
  and quote the actual mail. Keep permanent and complete records of
  all mail.

3. The biggest points are awarded for the greatest deceptions. Some
  snakes in the lists below (the most deceitful ones) have actually
  installed out-of-state phone numbers, developed software for
  coordination, and have an international arsenal of infiltration
  points.

4. In particular go after the BIG MACS and MEDUSA, where the most
  fantastic points are awarded. Some BIG MACS know of MEDUSA; they
  are called MEDUSA'S SISTERS.

5. The categories listed below of SUSPECTED SNAKES, TENTACLES,
  ACCOMPLICES, BIG MACS, and  MEDUSA are not conclusive or
  definitive. In particular, some people in these lists may be
  INNOCENT BYSTANDERS, and their harassment should be minimized. But,
  be careful! the SNAKES, TENTACLES, ACCOMPLICES, BIG MACS, and
  MEDUSA will all claim to be INNOCENT BYSTANDERS.

(rules subject to change without notice. watch for further
announcements.)

UPDATES
===

  updates on the SQUISH contest will be posted regularly. Send in
  notice of the more spectacular point accumulations with proof for
  verifications immediately and the Halls of Fame and Shame.
  Unverified points are not valid toward the cash prize.


THE CASH PRIZE
===

  A cash prize will be awarded to the first person to surpass 500
  points, one dollar per point. The person may continue playing to
  continue to gain cash. Further awards may be presented to close
  contenders. Some restrictions apply. Void where prohibited. Tax not
  included. In the case of deceased victims the award will be given
  to the nearest living relative, or the Federation of Associations
  of Cyberspace Everywhere (FACE) if all relatives have met 
  mysterious fatal accidents as well. If the world economies have
  collapsed from cyberanarchist sabotage before the award is 
  granted, no further action is necessary (this constitutes the final
  sign of the Apocalypse).


DEADLINE
===

  TIME IS RUNNING OUT! AVOID INQUIRING FURTHER OR WAITING FOR FURTHER
  INSTRUCTIONS. START IMMEDIATELY! MONTHS OF PARTICIPATION ARE
  REQUIRED TO ACCUMULATE COMPETITIVE STANDING. SOME PARTICIPANTS
  ALREADY HAVE A HEAD START.
  
  THE CASH PRIZE WILL BE AWARDED APRIL 1, 1994. FURTHER INCREMENTS
  WILL BE AWARDED AT YEARLY INTERVALS THEREAFTER.


MORE ABOUT `SQUISH' AND `FACE'
===

  The Federation of Associations of Cyberspace, Everywhere was founded
  in 1994 as a group that coordinates the activities among the many
  different online organizations. We have played a very low-profile
  role to date, and wanted to find some way of promoting our newfound
  alliance. We have groups combined from BBSes, local area networks,
  the Internet, and other global and local networks around the world
  (see below).

  We have built up some membership funds from the contributing
  organizations and private contributions to provide the prize money
  for SQUISH, and some private individuals have donated significant
  amounts. The contest was inspired by S.Boxx, who was the architect
  of point classifications and the current opponent lists. S.Boxx has
  also promised to provide any funds necessary for the successful
  completion of the contest. We hope that recent interest into snakes
  and tentacles by many on the Internet will make the contest
  spirited entertainment and a strong success.

  We encourage reporters and the media to use this announcement as our
  official press release. Feel free to redistribute or comment on
  this announcement in any forum.

I thought this FAQ from Grady Ward (sometimes on our list, sometimes not)
might fit with the discussion of password and passphrase security.

There's a lot of crunching needed to determine if a selected passphrase has
enough entropy. (And to some extent, it is not computable to determine if a
string has entropy L, as a sufficiently clever attacker may realize a
seemingly complex string actually is much simpler, more predictable, lower
entropy than other analyses might suggest.)

As others have said, using these sources for passphrases is a Bad Idea:

- phrases from popular songs (and several levels of permutations)
- famous quotes (and permutations, e.g, "Four scored but seven didn't" is
not a very good passphrase, in comparison with "Fully weaSSel lampshop
3856fq3")
- lines from novels, television

These all have much less entropy than the "shocking nonsense" that many
recommend. Memorizing good passphrases is expected to be hard. Personal
information leaks bits. Finding personal information that is meaningful to
one, but has not been revealed to others (or included in databases) is
tough.

Anyway, here is Grady's FAQ on this:


PASSPHRASE FAQ
V. 1.0    1 November 1993


'"PGP," warns Dorothy Denning, a Georgetown University professor
who has worked closely with the National Security Agency, "could
potentially become a widespread problem.'  -- (E. Dexheimer)

FAQ: How do I choose a good password or phrase?

ANS: Shocking nonsense makes the most sense

        With the intrinsic strength of some of the modern
encryption, authentication, and message digest algorithms such as
RSA, MD5, SHS and IDEA the user password or phrase is becoming
more and more the focus of vulnerability.

        For example, Deputy Ponder with the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department admitted in early 1993 that both they and the
FBI despaired of breaking the PGP 1.0 system except through a
successful dictionary attack (trying many possible passwords or
phrases from lists of probable choices and their variations)
rather than "breaking" the underlying cryptographic algorithm
mathematically.

        The fundamental reason why attacking or trying to guess the
user's password or phrase will increasingly be the focus of
cryptanalysis is that the user's choice of password may represent
a much simpler cryptographic key than optimal for the encryption
algorithm being used. This weakness of the user's password choice
provides the potential cryptanalytic wedge.

        For example, suppose a user chooses the password 'david.' On
the surface the entropy of this key (or the number of different
equiprobable key states) appears to be five characters chosen from
a set of twenty-six with replacements: 26^5 or 1.188 x 10^7. But
since the user is apparently biased toward common given names,
which a majority appear in lists numbering only 6,000-7,000
entries, the true entropy is undoubtedly much closer to 6.5 x
10^3, or about four orders of magnitude smaller than the raw
length might suggest. (In fact this password probably possesses a
much smaller entropy than even this for the very common name
"david" would be one of the first names to be checked by an
optimized dictionary attack program.)

        In other words the "entropy" of a keyspace is not a fixed
physical quantity: the cryptanalyst can exploit whole cultural
biases and contexts, not just byte frequencies, digraphs, or even
whole-word correlations to reduce the key space he or she is
trying to explore.

        To thwart this avenue of attack we would like to discover a
method of selecting passwords or phrases that have at least as
many bits of entropy (or "hard-to-guessness") as the entropy of
the cryptographic key of the underlying algorithm being used.

        To compare, DES (Data Encryption Standard) is believed to
have about 54-55 bits (~4 x 10 ^16) of entropy while the IDEA
algorithm is believed to have about 128 bits (~3.5 x 10^38) of
entropy. The closer the entropy of the user's password or phrase
is to the intrinsic entropy of the cryptographic key of the
underlying algorithm being used, the more likely an attacker would
need to search a substantially larger portion of the algorithm's
key space in order to rediscover the key.

        Unfortunately many documents suggest choosing passwords or
phrases that are distinctly inferior to the latest method. For
example, one white paper widely archived on the internet suggests
selecting an original password by constructing an acronym from a
popular song lyric or from a line of script from, for example, the
SF movie "Star Wars". Both of these ideas turn out to be weak
because both the entire script to Stars Wars and entire sets of
song lyrics to thousands of popular songs are available on-line to
everyone and, in some cases, are already embedded into "crack"
dictionary attack programs (See ftp.uwp.edu).

        However, the conflict between choosing an easy-to-remember
key and choosing a key with a high level of entropy is not a
hopeless task if we exploit mnemonic devices that have been used
for a long time outside the field of cryptography. With the goal
of making up a passphrase not included in any existing corpus yet
very easy to remember, an effective technique is one known as
"shocking nonsense."

        "Shocking nonsense" means to make up a short phrase or
sentence that is both nonsensical and shocking in the culture of
the user, that is, it contains grossly obscene, racist, impossible
or other extreme juxtaposition of ideas. This technique is
permissable because the passphrase, by its nature, is never
revealed to anyone with sensibilities to be offended.

        Shocking nonsense is unlikely to be duplicated anywhere
because it does not describe a matter-of-fact that could be
accidentally rediscovered by anyone else and the emotional
evocation makes it difficult for the creator to forget. A mild
example of such shocking nonsense might be: "mollusks peck my
galloping genitals ." The reader can undoubtedly make up many far
more shocking or entertaining examples for himself or herself.

        Even relatively short phrases offer acceptable entropy
because the far larger "alphabet" pool of word symbols that may be
chosen than the 26 characters that form the Roman alphabet. Even
choosing from a vocabulary of a few thousand words a five word
phrase might have on the order of 58 to 60 bits of entropy -- more
than what is needed for the DES algorithm, for example.

        When you are permitted to use passphrases of arbitrary
length (in PGP for example) it is not necessary to further perturb
your 'shocking nonsense' passphrase to include numbers or special
symbols because the pool of word choices is already very high. Not
needing those special symbols or numbers (that are not
intrinsically meaningful) makes the shocking nonsense passphrase
that much easier to remember.

        If you are forced to use, say, a Unix password utility that
permits only passwords of restricted length, one good strategy is
to process a your secret passphrase using MD5 or SHA, then
UUENCODE the result and select your shorter key from the output.
See Appendix C and D for actual MD5 and SHA source implmentations.


Appendix A.  For software developers

        For software developers designing "front-ends" or user
interfaces to conventional short-password applications, very good
results will come from permitting the user arbitrary length
passphrases that are then "crunched" or processed using a strong
digest algorithm such as the 160-bit SHS (Secure Hash Standard) or
the 128-bit MD5 (Message Digest rev.5).[See following Appendices]
The interface program then chooses the appropriate number of bits
from the digest and supplies them to the engine enforcing a short
password. This 'key crunching' technique will assure the developer
that even the short password key space will have a far greater
opportunity of being fully exploited by the user.

   John Kelsey writes:
        "I think it's a really good idea to use a randomly-generated
salt to generate a key from a password, and that this salt should
be as large as possible. Basically, this is to keep an attacker
from spending lots of computer power *once* to generate a
dictionary of likely keys.  If users use good techniques to choose
passwords, this won't matter much, but if they don't, this may
save them from having their encrypted files or transmissions
routinely read.  The simplest scheme I can see for this is simply
to prepend a 128-bit salt (generated as strongly as possible) to
each encrypted file.  Generate the key from the password by pre-
filling a buffer with the 128-bit salt, then XORing in the keyed-
in password, or by appending the key to the keyed-in password.
Then, run SHA or MD5 or whatever to get the key.
   A secondary point:  Adding a random salt ensures that people
who use the same password/passphrase for lots of
files/transmissions don't get the same key every time.  Since most
successful attacks against modern encryption schemes use *lots* of
ciphertext from the same key, this might add some practical
security, at relatively low cost."

Appendix B. A tool to experimentally investigate entropy

        A practical Unix tool for investigating the entropy of
typical user keys can be found in Wu and Manber's 'agrep'
(approximate grep) similarity pattern matching tool available in C
source from cs.arizona.edu [192.12.69.5]. This tool can determine
the "edit distance," that is, the number of insertions,
substitutions, or deletions that would be required of an arbitrary
pattern in order for it to match any of a large corpus of words or
phrases, say the usr/dict word list, or over the set of Star Trek
trivia archives. The user can then adjust the pattern to give an
arbitrary high threshold difference between it and common words
and phrases in the corpus to make crack programs that
systematically vary known strings less likely to succeed. It is
often surprising to discover that a substring pattern like
"hxirtes" is only of edit distance two from as many as forty
separate words ranging from "bushfires" to "whitest." Certainly no
password or phrase ought to be chosen as a working password or
phrase that is within two or fewer edit distance from a known
string or substring in any on-line collection.

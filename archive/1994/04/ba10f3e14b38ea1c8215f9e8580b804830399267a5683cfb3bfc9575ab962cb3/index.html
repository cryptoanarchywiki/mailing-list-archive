Well, it's been a couple of days since I asked if anyone knew  
anything about Terra Libra.  Nobody has spoken up.

Since, on the surface, Terra Libra sounds like it would be  
interesting to many on this list, I'm posting a condensed version of  
the flyer I received in the mail.  I am not affiliated with Terra  
Libra in any way.  Actually, I wonder it is really just a money  
making scam.

Here goes...

----------------------


TERRA LIBRA IS *THE BIG IDEA* THAT IS INSPIRING FREEDOM-LOVERS AROUND  
THE WORLD TO EFFECTIVE ACTION -- and filling their pockets with  
oodles of boodle!!! [yeah right - jm]


Dear Friend of Freedom,

  My name is Frederick Mann [who? - jm].  I have lived free from  
government coercion of practically all kinds for many years in  
several parts of the world.  I have learned a great deal about  
practical freedom.  I'm now ready to share what I've learned with you  
[for a price -jm].  As you can see from the testimonials in this  
letter [proof by anecdote? - jm] and from the progress reported on  
page 4, I've also become very successful at sharing what I've learned  
about freedom [by getting money from suckers? -jm].  Furthermore, I'm  
providing you with the opportunity to share freedom with others and  
make a fortune while doing so...If you want to [give me money first -  
jm].
  

  

THE FORCES OF TYRANNY SEEM TO BE GAINING GROUND

  Have you been getting that sinking feeling in your gut that things  
are terribly wrong in America?  Do you ever feel that our economic  
future is looking worse as each year passes?  Have you seen of read  
books likes _Bankruptcy 1995_ which say that our entire financial  
structure -- and even civilization itself [oh my! -jm] -- in America  
could collapse within a few years?  Do you sometimes think America is  
being engulfed by a rising tide of political corruption, crime,  
violence, mayhem, [scams -jm] and senseless murder?
   Do you think the government is making things better or worse?   
What do you think of the Waco massacre?  The so-called "war on  
drugs?"  IRS, ATF, and FDA terrorism?  What do you think of the  
government's asset forfeiture laws?  Socialized health care?  Do you  
think America is heading towards fascism or communism -- or the worse  
combination of both?  [asks a lot of questions, doesn't he. -jm]


BUT ALL IS NOT LOST -- IT'S NOT HOPELESS!!!  [phew! I was getting  
worried. - jm]

  Terra Libra is the new dimension in personal freedom, money, and  
power that changes everything.  Our unbeatable weapon is called [drum  
roll please -jm] Freedom Technology.  Terra Libra and Freedom  
Technology represents a societal breakthrough that completely changes  
the dynamics of money, power, domination [ooh, kinky -jm], and  
freedom.  Because of its people, its design, its business dynamics,  
its philosophy, its strategies, its tactics, its elements, its  
products, its networking, and its freedom technology, Terra Libra is  
by far the most advanced freedom organization ever conceived and  
created -- that I know of.  Terra Libra is unstoppable because people  
are by nature free and we have found the keys that enables you to  
enjoy freedom right now and to make a fortune spreading freedom to  
others.


THE TERRA LIBRA SOLUTION

  When you push against a system, it tends to push back.  Some people  
need to push and fight because that's their nature.  The success of  
our fight for freedom is likely to come from the combined results of  
very different strategies and tactics waged over a wide range of  
fronts.  The fundamental Terra Libra strategy is based on the  
understanding that the power of the tyrants comes from the victims.   
The victims surrender power to the tyrants.  If enough victims  
withdraw support, the tyranny collapses.  This is essentially the  
strategy Gandhi used to defeat the British Empire in India.
  

  One of the greatest strengths of Terra Libra is that we don't try  
to change the systems of tyranny.  We simply create our own free  
systems [who is that John Galt guy anyways? -jm]  Individuals acquire  
the tools to live free despite the tyrants.  Terra Libra and other  
organizations provide the free institutions that replace their  
coercive counterparts.  Such alternatives already exist is areas such  
as currencies, banking, communication, education, health care, etc.   
Eventually practically all the products and services now available in  
the public and private sectors -- and many more -- will be provided  
in the Terra Libra free market.  As people shift their economic  
activities from the public and private sectors into the free market  
of Terra Libra, the forces of tyranny automatically lose support and  
they are blown away.
  

  Terra Libra is the world's first truly free county.  It is a  
worldwide information-based country that extends across national  
borders.  Its inhabitants are Free Sovereign Citizens.  It has a Code  
based on individual sovereignty, self-ownership, private property,  
and voluntary exchange.  Terra Librans can do anything which doesn't  
harm others or their property.  They practice real or true free  
enterprise.  In fact, Terra Libra is the free-enterprise zone of the  
world.  The "Terra Libra Introductory Package" describes Terra Libra  
in more detail.
  


FREEDOM TECHNOLOGY

  Terra Librans have a "secret weapon" they use to live free despite  
coercive systems.  It's called Freedom Technology: the practical  
knowledge, methods, and skills to live free; the street-smart  
know-how that enables you to run rings around the forces of tyranny;  
the means to protect your income and assets from predatory tyrants;  
and ultimately, the means to blow away the bogus forces of tyranny.
  

  During the past few decades very powerful Freedom Technology has  
been developed to counterattack and defeat tyrants who violate their  
constitution.  Any reasonably well-informed person can run rings  
around the Infernal Revenue Stealers.  In addition to powerful  
methods to quickly persuade them to leave you alone, commercial liens  
can be used to encumber the personal property and destroy the credit  
rating of corrupt government officials who try to violate your rights  
[huh!? -jm] (see "Commercial Liens: A Most Potent Weapon")

  Freedom Technology enables you to exit most coercive government  
systems safely, legally, and elegantly.  You automatically increase  
your own power.  You gradually or quickly, partially or completely,  
withdraw your support from the tyrants.  So they lose power.  The  
power of the forces of tyranny depend completely on the power granted  
to them by their victims [you already said that -jm].  Withdraw the  
support and they collapse.  It is because of this phenomenon that the  
armed might of the East German military backed by 300,000 Russian  
troops couldn't keep the Berlin wall standing.  When a critical mass  
of people said, "No!!!  We've had enough!!!  We're mad as hell!!!  
We're not going to take it any more!!!" [I saw that movie, too -jm]  
the Berlin wall tumbled.  [and all this time I thought it was cheap  
concrete -jm]
  

  [skipping a bunch of stuff -jm]

QUALITY SUPPORT FOR TERRA LIBRA

  It's significant that the strongest support for Terra Libra comes  
from people who two qualities [they have money, and they send it to  
strangers -jm]
  

  o They are practical, successful professionals and business owners;
  

  o They are advanced freedom-thinkers who have studied the subject  
of freedom extensively and have been involved with other  
organizations that promote freedom [ah, that's how they got my  
address -jm].
  

  Generally, they regard the formation of Terra Libra and the  
concepts expressed in its reports as the most advanced, most  
practical, and most potentially profitable approach to freedom they  
have ever come across.
  


PATRONS AND PROFESSIONAL LIBERATORS

  An essential aspect of Terra Libra is Networking between Terra  
Librans.  To live free, we sometimes need expert services, for  
example, on how to beat the Infernal Revenue Stealers.  We also want  
to patronize each other's free-market businesses.  The "Terra Libra  
Introductory Package" includes a Freedom Technology Directory,  
listing our patrons and Professional Liberators.  Following is a  
partial listing from this Directory.
  

  [list deleted]
  


WHAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED SO FAR

  Much more has been achieved than space allows me to mention.  A few  
highlights:
  

  o There are now 32 Patrons and 45 Professional Liberators in:  
[various states and countries -jm]
  

  o Our _Freedom Technology Resource Guide_ contains over 100 entries  
of individuals, organizations, and publications from all over the  
world -- valuable sources of Freedom Technology.
  

  o The November 1993 issue of the _Orange County Liberty Bell_ ran a  
full-page feature on Terra Libra.
  

  o The Terra Libra "country" concept has been expanded to include  
"Terra Libra Territories" of which there are already several,  
including the international holdings of a major Pennsylvania  
investment company.
  

  o An organization has been established to create a worldwide  
economic system with a %100 gold-based currency.  The system will  
interface with current banking systems.  It's organized so that each  
aspect of it is perfectly legal in the country where that aspect  
operates.  Users of the gold-based system will be able to enjoy most  
of the services they now receive from their local bank.  They will be  
able to deposit local currency checks and bank notes.  The system  
will be able to write checks in local currency.  Secure electronic  
transfer will be possible for transactions between users of the  
system [*** ding ding ding *** how secure? -jm].  Users will be able  
to withdraw funds from ATMs.  [can't be too secure then -jm]  The  
gold will be maintained by solid financial institutions, as safe as  
possible from thieves and robbers of all kinds [uh huh, right -jm].   
The gold will be insured and subject to regular independent audit.   
Initial financing has been received and development is proceeding.   
We expect the system to be operational around June 1994.  This system  
could play a major role in creating a solid alternative of being able  
to bank in private and being protected against the collapse of paper  
currencies!
  

  o We have developed the mechanisms to market freedom products and  
services profitably.
  

  o Personnel has grown to six full-time and several part-time.
  

  o Full-page or multi-page advertisements have appeared or will soon  
appear in _Reason_ magazine, _Libertarian Part News_, _Freedom  
Network News_, _Liberty_ magazine, and other publications.
  

  o We mail to over 10,000 prospective customers [marks? -jm] every  
month.

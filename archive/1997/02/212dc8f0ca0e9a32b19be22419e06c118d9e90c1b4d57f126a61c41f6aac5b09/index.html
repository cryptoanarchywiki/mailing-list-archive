Dresden: A Real Holocaust

by Kevin Alfred Strom 

The night of February 13th, and February 14th, Valentine's Day, mark an
ominous anniversary in the history of Western Civilization. For
beginning on the night of February 13th, 1945, occurred the destruction
of Dresden. 

On the eve of Valentine's Day, 1945, World War II in Europe was nearly
over. For all practical purposes Germany was already defeated. Italy,
and Germany's other European allies, had fallen by the wayside. The Red
Army was rushing to occupy vast areas of what had been Germany in the
East, while the allies of the Soviets, the British and Americans, were
bombing what was left of Germany's defenses and food and transportation
infrastructure into nonexistence. 

And what was Dresden? Most of you have probably heard of Dresden China,
and that delicately executed and meticulously detailed porcelain is
really a perfect symbol for that city. For centuries Dresden had been a
center of art and culture, and refined leisure and recreation. She was a
city of art museums and theatres, circuses and sports stadia, a town of
ancient half-timbered buildings looking for all the world like those of
medieval England, with venerable churches and centuries-old cathedrals
gracing her skyline. She was a city of artists and craftsmen, of actors
and dancers, of tourists and the merchants and hotels that served them.
Above all, what Dresden was, was defined during the war by what she was
not. She had no significant military or industrial installations.
Because of this, Dresden had become, above all other things that she
was, a city of children, of women, of refugees, and of the injured and
maimed who were recovering from their wounds in her many hospitals. 

These women and children, these wounded soldiers, these infirm and
elderly people, these refugees fleeing from the brutal onslaught of the
Communist armies to the East, had come to Dresden because it was
commonly believed at the time that Dresden would not be attacked. Its
lack of strategic or military or industrial significance, and the
well-known presence of hundreds of thousands of innocent civilian
refugees and even Allied prisoners of war, seemed to guarantee safety to
the city. Surely, it was thought, not even a the most powerful and
determined enemy would be so depraved and sadistic, and so wasteful of
that enemy's own resources, to attack such a city. But the people of
Dresden, who were happily attending the cinema or eating dinner at home
or watching the show-horses in the circus on that fateful night were
wrong, wrong, wrong. And their leaders were also wrong, for the city was
virtually open and undefended and only minimal civil defense
preparations had been made. 

Dresden's population had almost doubled in the months before the attack,
mainly as a result of the influx of refugees from the Eastern Front,
most of them women and young children. According to British historian
David Irving, the briefings given to the British bomber squadrons before
the attack on Dresden were curiously different. In one, the soldiers
were told that their target was the railway center of Dresden. In
another, they were told that the target was a poison-gas factory. In yet
another, they were told that the target was a marshalling-grounds for
troops in the city. Another was told that the target was a major
arsenal. These were all lies. 

The only marshalling-grounds for what few troops were in the area were
located well outside the city. The arsenal had burned down in 1916.
There were factories for toothpaste and baby-powder in Dresden, but none
for poison gas. There were, in fact, no fewer than eighteen railway
stations in Dresden, but only one was hit by the bombing, and that was
barely touched and in fact was operating again just three days later. 

According to copious documentation unearthed by David Irving from the
archives of the American and British governments, the point of the
attack was in fact to inflict the maximum loss of life on the civilian
population and particularly to kill as many refugees as possible who
were fleeing from the Red Army. In achieving these goals it was highly
successful. It was thus planned and executed by those at the very
highest levels of the British and American governments, who to attain
their purposes even lied to their own soldiers and citizens, who to this
day have never been told the full story by their leaders. 

How was this devastating effect accomplished? 

At 10:10 PM on February 13th, the first wave of the attack, consisting
of the British Number 5 Bomber Group, began. The attacking force
consisted of about 2,000 bombers with additional support craft, which
dropped over 3,000 high explosive and 650,000 incendiary bombs (more
commonly known as firebombs) on the center of the city. Incendiary bombs
are not known for their efficiency per pound in destroying heavy
equipment such as military hardware or railroad tracks, but are
extremely effective in producing maximum loss of human life. The loads
carried by the bombers were over 75 per cent incendiaries. In fact, the
goal of the first wave of the attack was, according to British air
commander Sir Arthur Bomber Harris, to set the city well on fire. That
he did. 

The lack of any effective anti-aircraft defenses allowed the bombers to
drop to very low altitudes and thus a relatively high degree of
precision and visual identification of targets was achieved. Despite the
fact that they could clearly see that the marked target area contained
hospitals and sports stadia and residential areas of center city
Dresden, the bombers nevertheless obeyed orders and rained down a fiery
death upon the unlucky inhabitants of that city on a scale which had
never before been seen on planet Earth. Hundreds of thousands of
innocents were literally consumed by fire, an actual holocaust by the
true definition of the word: complete consumption by fire. 

The incendiaries started thousands of fires and, aided by a stiff wind
and the early-on destruction of the telephone exchanges that might have
summoned firefighters from nearby towns, these fires soon coalesced into
one unimaginably huge firestorm. Now such firestorms are not natural
phenomena, and are seldom created by man, so few people have any idea of
their nature. Basically, what happened was this: The intense heat caused
by the huge column of smoke and flame, miles high and thousands of acres
in area, created a terrific updraft of air in the center of the column.
This created a very low pressure at the base of the column, and
surrounding fresh air rushed inward at speeds estimated to be thirty
times that of an ordinary tornado. An ordinary tornado wind-force is a
result of temperature differences of perhaps 20 to 30 degrees
centigrade. In this firestorm the temperature differences were on the
order of 600 to 1,000 degrees centigrade. This inward-rushing air
further fed the flames, creating a literal tornado of fire, with winds
in the surrounding area of many hundreds of miles per hour--sweeping
men, women, children, animals, vehicles and uprooted trees pell-mell
into the glowing inferno. 

But this was only the first stage of the plan. 

Exactly on schedule, three hours after the first attack, a second
massive armada of British bombers arrived, again loaded with high
explosive and massive quantities of incendiary bombs. The residents of
Dresden, their power systems destroyed by the first raid, had no warning
of the second. Again the British bombers attacked the center city of
Dresden, this time dividing their targets--one half of the bombs were to
be dropped into the center of the conflagration, to keep it going, the
other half around the edges of the firestorm. No pretense whatever was
made of selecting military targets. The timing of the second armada was
such as to ensure that a large quantity of the surviving civilians would
have emerged from their shelters by that time, which was the case, and
also in hopes that rescue and firefighting crews would have arrived from
surrounding cities, which also proved to be true. The firefighters and
medics thus incinerated hadn't needed the telephone exchange to know
that they were needed--the firestorm was visible from a distance of 200
miles. 

It is reported that body parts, pieces of clothing, tree branches, huge
quantities of ashes, and miscellaneous debris from the firestorm fell
for days on the surrounding countryside as far away as eighteen miles.
After the attack finally subsided, rescue workers found nothing but
liquefied remains of the inhabitants of some shelters, where even the
metal kitchen utensils had melted from the intense heat. 

The next day, Ash Wednesday and Valentine's Day, 1945, medical and other
emergency personnel from all over central Germany had converged on
Dresden. Little did they suspect that yet a third wave of bombers was on
its way, this time American. This attack had been carefully coordinated
with the previous raids. Four hundred fifty Flying Fortresses and a
support contingent of fighters arrived to finish the job at noon. I
quote from David Irving's The Destruction of Dresden: 

"Just a few hours before Dresden had been a fairy-tale city of spires
and cobbled streets .... now total war had put an end to all that.
...The ferocity of the US raid of 14th February had finally brought the
people to their knees... but it was not the bombs which finally
demoralised the people ... it was the Mustang fighters, which suddenly
appeared low over the city, firing on everything that moved .... one
section of the Mustangs concentrated on the river banks, where masses of
bombed-out people had gathered. ... British prisoners who had been
released from their burning camps were among the first to suffer the
discomfort of machine-gunning attacks .... wherever columns of tramping
people were marching in or out of the city they were pounced on by the
fighters, and machine-gunned or raked with cannon fire." 

Ladies and gentlemen, on this program I can only give you a bare glimpse
of the inhuman horror of the holocaust of Dresden. In Dresden, no fewer
than 135,000 innocent victims died, with some estimates as high as
300,000. More died in Dresden than died in the well-known attacks on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. More destruction befell Dresden in one day than
was inflicted on the whole of Britain during the entire war. And yet you
haven't been told. 

I urge every one of you to read The Destruction of Dresden by David
Irving. I assure you, after reading Irving's book, you will never take
seriously the Establishment's version of what happened in that war
again. 

What you ought to take seriously, though, is the fact that the same
clique that controlled the traitorous Roosevelt and Churchill
governments, whose hatred of our race and civilization and whose
alliance with Communism were the real causes of the holocaust of
Dresden, still controls our government and our media today. It is they
who are pushing for a disarmed, racially mixed America. It is they who
promote the teaching of sodomy to our young children. It is they who are
destroying our industrial infrastructure in the name of a global
economy. It is they who created the drug subculture and then also the
police state agencies which pretend to fight it. The hour is very late
for America and indeed for all of Western civilization. But if patriots
will heed our call, then there is no reason for despair. For the enemies
of our nation may have power, but their power is based on lies. Won't
you help us cut through the chain of lies that holds our people in
mental slavery?

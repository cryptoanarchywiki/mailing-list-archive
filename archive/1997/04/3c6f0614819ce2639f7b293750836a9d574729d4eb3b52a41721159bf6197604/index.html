CRYPTO '97

General Information

17-21 August 1997
Santa Barbara, California, USA

Crypto '97 is the 17th international conference on cryptology held at
the University of California Santa Barbara. The academic program
covers all aspects of cryptology; specific papers will be announced on
1 May. Formal proceedings, published by Springer-Verlag, will be
provided to all attendees at the conference.

Crypto '97 is sponsored by the International Association for
Cryptologic Research (IACR), in cooperation with the IEEE Computer
Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy, and the Computer
Science Department of the University of California, Santa Barbara
(UCSB). Program Chair is Burt Kaliski, Jr., and General Chair is Bruce
Schneier.

In addition to selected and invited papers, there will be a rump
session on Tuesday evening for selected informal presentations.
Facilities are available for attendees to demonstrate hardware,
software, and other items of cryptologic interest. If you are
interested, contact the General Chair by 12 June 1997.

The social program will include hosted dinner receptions on Monday and
Tuesday nights, and a beach barbecue on Wednesday evening. Breakfasts
and lunches will be served at the university dining hall.

Conference Facilities: The workshop will be held on the campus of the
University of California, Santa Barbara.  The campus is located
adjacent to the Santa Barbara airport and the Pacific Ocean; free
shuttle bus service from the airport is available. Reasonably priced
accommodations are available in the university dormitories for
participants and their registered guests. Children under the age of 13
are not allowed to stay in the dormitories, so those bringing younger
children will need to make separate arrangements in one of the nearby
hotels (see Hotels, below). Parking on campus is available at no cost
to participants, but a permit must be requested on arrival. Smoking
inside campus buildings is prohibited. The food is good.

Registration: The conference is open to all interested parties, but
the number of attendees at the workshop is limited to 500;
pre-registration is strongly advised. To register, fill out the
accompanying registration form and return it to the address on the
form along with payment in full before 12 July 1997. Those bringing a
guest are also required to submit the guest registration form. Campus
accommodations will be available on a first come, first served basis
for attendees who register by 12 July 12 1997. Registrations received
after 12 July 1997 may be accepted if space is available but cannot be
guaranteed. The conference fee includes participation in the program
and all social functions, as well as membership in the IACR and a
subscription to the Journal of Cryptology. The room and board charges
include dormitory lodging Sunday night through Wednesday night, and
breakfast and lunch on Monday through Thursday. Technical sessions
will run from Monday morning to Thursday noon, with a free half day on
Tuesday afternoon.

A limited number of stipends are available to students unable to
obtain funding. Students are invited to apply if such assistance is
needed. Requests for stipends should be received by the General Chair
before 14 June 1997. Students registering for the conference need to
provide verification of their student status with a letter from their
Supervisor or Department Chair and a photocopy of their student ID
card. Preference will be given to students whose papers are accepted
and who will present the papers themselves

Cancellations received, in writing, by the General Chair by 15 July
1997 will be considered for a refund in full minus $75 for a copy of
the Proceedings and handling costs. No refunds will be made for
cancellations received after 15 July 1997, but a copy of the
conference Proceedings will be mailed to those registered but unable
to attend.

Travel Information: The campus is located approximately two miles from
the Santa Barbara airport, which is served by several airlines
including American, American West, Delta, United, and US Air.
Complimentary shuttle bus service will be provided between the Santa
Barbara airport and the campus on Sunday and Thursday afternoons. All
major rental car agencies are represented in Santa Barbara. AMTRAK
also has rail connections from both San Francisco and Los Angeles.
Santa Barbara is approximately 100 miles (160 km) north of the Los
Angeles airport and 350 miles (560 km) south of San Francisco.

Hotels: For those who choose not to stay in the dormitories, the
following is a partial list of hotels in the area. Those who choose to
stay off campus are responsible for making their own reservations, and
early reservations are advised since August is a popular season in
Santa Barbara. Note that Goleta is closer to UCSB than Santa Barbara
is to UCSB, but a car will probably be required to travel between any
hotel and the campus. All prices are subject to change: prices should
be confirmed by calling the hotels directly. However, mention Crypto
'97 at UCSB when you are making your reservations, since at several of
the hotels you will be eligible for the university rate, which can be
a significant savings. We are not able to book block rooms in these
hotels, so please make reservations as early as possible. The quality
of the hotels ranges from rather expensive beach-front resorts to
basic inexpensive accommodations. For further information, try

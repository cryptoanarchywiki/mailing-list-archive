I Never Thought I'd Be the One Telling You This:
I Actually Read a Piece of e-mail and I'm Going to Europe on the Proceeds!

Hello!

My name is Karen Liddell; I'm a 35-year-old mom,wife, and part-time
accountant.  As a rule, I delete all unsolicited "junk" e-mail and use my
account primarily for business.  I received what I assumed was this same
e-mail countless times and deleted it each time.

About two months ago I received it again and, because of the catchy line, I
finally read it.  Afterwards, I thought, "OK, I give in, I'm going to try
this.  I can certainly afford to invest $20 and, on the other hand, there's
nothing wrong with creating a little excess cash."  I promptly mailed four $5
bills and, after receiving the reports, sent out some e-mail advertisements.
 After reading the reports, I also learned how easy it is to bulk e-mail for
free!

I was not prepared for the results.  Everyday for the last six weeks, my P.O.
box has been overflowing with $5 bills; many days the excess fills up an
extra mail bin and I've had to upgrade to the corporate-size box!  I am
stunned by all the money that keeps rolling in!

My husband and I have been saving for several years to make a substantial
downpayment on a house.  Now, not only are we purchasing a house with 40%
down, we're going to Venice, Italy to celebrate!

I promise you, if you follow the directions in this e-mail and be prepared to
eventually set aside about an hour each day to follow up (and count your
money!), you will make at least as much money as we did.  You don't need to
be a wiz at the computer, but I'll bet you already are.  If you can open an
envelope, remove the money, and send an e-mail message, then you're on your
way to the bank.  Take the time to read this so you'll understand how easy it
is.  If I can do this, so can you!

The following is a copy of the e-mail I read:

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
                  This is a LEGAL, MONEY-MAKING PHENOMENON.
        PRINT this letter, read the directions, THEN READ IT AGAIN!!!

You are about to embark on the most profitable and unique program you may
ever see.  Many times over, it has demonstrated and proven its ability to
generate large amounts of CASH.  This program is showing fantastic appeal
with a huge and ever-growing on-line population desirous of additional
income.

This is a legitimate, LEGAL, money-making opportunity.  It does not require
you to come in contact with people, do any hard work, and best of all, you
never have to leave the house, except to get the mail and go to the bank!

This truly is the lucky break you've been waiting for!  Simply follow the
easy instructions in this letter, and your financial dreams will come true!
 When followed correctly, this multi-level marketing program works
perfectly..100% EVERY TIME!
Thousands of people have used this program to:
     - Raise capital to start their own business
     - Pay off debts
     - Buy homes, cars, etc.
This is your chance, don't pass it up!

OVERVIEW OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY ELECTRONIC MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING PROGRAM

This is what you will do to reach financial freedom:

You will send thousands of people a product for $5.00 that costs next to
nothing to produce and e-mail.  As with all multi-level businesses, you will
increase your business building your downline and selling the products
(reports).  Every state in the U.S. allows you to recruit new multi-level
business online (via your computer).

The products in this program are a series of four business and financial
reports costing $5.00 each.  Each order you receive via "snail mail" will
include:
     -$5.00 cash
     -The name and number of the report they are ordering
     -The e-mail address where you will e-mail them the report they ordered.

To fill each order, you simply e-mail the product to the buyer.  THAT'S IT!
 The $5.00 is yours!  This is the EASIEST multi-level marketing business
anywhere!

FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER AND BE PREPARED TO REAP THE STAGGERING
BENEFITS!

*******I N S T R U C T I O N S*********

This is what you MUST do:
1. Order all 4 reports shown on the list below.

*For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME &amp; NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE
ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR RETURN POSTAL ADDRESS (in case of a
problem) to the person whose name appears on the list next to the report.

*When you place your order, make sure you order each of the four reports.
 You will need all four reports so that you can save them on your computer
and resell them.

*Usually within 10 days you will receive, via e-mail, the four reports.  Save
them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the
1,000's of people who will order them from you.

2. IMPORTANT-DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each
report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than is instructed
below in steps "a" through "f" or you will lose out on the majority of your
profits.  Once you understand the way this works, you'll also see how it
doesn't work if you change it.!!  Remember, this method has been tested, and i
f you alter it , it will not work.

a.  Look below for the listing of available reports.

b.  After you've ordered the four reports, take this advertisement and remove
the address under REPORT #4.  This person has made it through the cycle and
is no doubt counting their 50 grand!

c.  Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to REPORT #4.

d.  Move the name and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3.

e.  Move the name and address under REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2.

f.  Insert your name and address in the REPORT #1 position.

  Please make sure that you copy everyone's name and address ACCURATELY!!!

3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, and save it
to your computer.  Make NO changes to the instruction portion of this letter.

4. Now you,re ready to start an advertising campaign on the WORLDWIDE WEB!
 Advertising on the WEB is very inexpensive, and there are HUNDREDS of FREE
places to advertise.  Another avenue you could use for advertising is e-mail
lists.  You can buy these lists for under $20 for 2,000 addresses or you can
pay someone a minimal charge to take care of it for you.

5.  For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report
that they ordered.  THAT'S IT!  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL
ORDERS!  This will gaurantee that the e-mail THEY send out with YOUR name and
address on it, will be prompt because they can't advertise until they receive
the report!

AVAILABLE REPORTS
******Order Each REPORT by NUMBER and NAME******

Notes:
-  ALWAYS SEND $5 CASH FOR EACH REPORT (checks not accepted)
-  Make sure that the cash is concealed by wrapping it in two sheets of paper
-  On one of those sheets of paper, include:  1.) the NUMBER and NAME of the
report you are ordering, 2.) your e-mail address and 3.) your postal address
(in case of problems) It is suggested that you rent a mailbox to avoid having
your home address being sent to millions of peolple.

   HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PLAN WILL MAKE YOU MONEY$

Let's say that you decide to start small just to see how well it works.
 Assume your goal is to get 10 people to participate on your first level.
 (Placing a lot of FREE ads on the internet will EASILY get a larger
response.)  Also assume that everyone else in your organization gets ONLY 10
downline members.  Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING results
below.

1st level-your 10 members with $5........................................
.$50
2nd level-10 members from those 10($5 x 100)..........................$500
3rd level-10 members from those 100($5 x 1,000)......................$5,000
4th level-10 members from those 1,000($5 x 10,000).................$50,000
                                       THIS TOTALS-----------$55,500

Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate on;y recruit
10 people each.  Think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people
to participate!  Most peolple get 100's of participants.  THINK ABOUT IT!

Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you can
afford $20).  You obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is
FREE!

*****TIPS FOR SUCCESS*****

*  TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS!  Be prompt, professional, and follow the

    directions accurately.

*  Send for the four reports immediately so you will have them when the
orders
   start coming in because:

When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the requested product/report
to comply with the U.S. Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 3005 in
the U.S. Code, also Code of Federal Regulations vol. 16, sections 255 and
436, which state that "a product or service must be exchanged for money
received."

*  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE.

*  Be patient and persistent with this program.  If you follow the
instructions exactly
   the results will undoubtedly be SUCCESSFUL!

*  ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED!

*****YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINE*****

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

If you don't receive 10 to 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks, continue
advertising until you do.  Then, a couple of weeks later you should receive
at least 100 orders for REPORT #2.  If you don't, continue advertising until
you do.  Once you have received 100 or more orders for REPORT #2, YOU CAN
RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will
continue to roll in!

THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:
Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a
DIFFERENT report.  You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are ordering from you.  If you want to generate more income,
send another batch of e-mails and start the whole process again!  There is no
limit to the income you will generate from this business!

*****T E S T I M O N I A L S*****
This Program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY!  Especially the rule
of not trying to place your name in a different position, it won't work and
you'll lose alot of potential income.  I'm living proof that it works.  It
really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money, with little cost
to you.  If you do choose to participate, follow the program exactly, and
you'll be on your way to financial security.                  Sean

My name is Frank.  My wife Doris, and I live in Bel-Air, MD.  I am a cost
accountant with a major U.S. corporation and I make pretty good money.  When
I received the program I grumbled to Doris about receiving "junk mail".  I
made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and the
percentages involved.  I "knew" it wouldn't work.  Doris totally ignored my
supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet.  I made merciless fun of
her, and was ready to lay the old "I told you so" on her when the thing
didn't work... well, the laugh was on me!  Within 2 weeks she had received
over 50 responses.  Within 45 days she had received over $147,200 in $5
bills!  I was shocked!  I was sure that I had it all figured and that it
wouldn't work.  I AM a believer now.  I have joined Doris in her "hobby".  I
did have 7 more years until retirement, but I think of the "rat race" and
it's not for me.  We owe it all to MLM.                          Frank T.,

The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is
honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to get a large amount of
money in a short time.  I was approached several times before I checked this
out.  I joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal
effort and money required.  To my astonishment, I received $36,470.00 in the
first 14 weeks, with money still coming in.                     Sincerely
Yours, Phillip A. Brown

Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to
participate in this plan.  But conservative that I am, I decided that the
initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't
get enough orders to at least get my money back.  Boy, was I surprised when I
found my medium-size post office box crammed with orders!  For awhile, it got
so overloaded that I had to start picking up my mail at the window.  I'll
make more money this year than in any 10 years of my life before.  The nice
thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where in the U.S. the people
live.  There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return.
                     Mary Rockland, Lansing, MI

This is my third time to participate in this plan.  We have quit our jobs,
and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money.
 The only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it.  For
your sake, and for your family's sake, don't pass up this golden opportunity.
 Good luck and happy spending!

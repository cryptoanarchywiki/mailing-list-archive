Johnny doesn't know the first thing about proper firearms safety.
Johnny's been taught at school to run away very very fast when he sees a 
	gun and tell a responsible adult right away so that a responsible

Johnny hears the government say that money launderers are very, very bad 
	people.
Johnny feels money launderers must be almost as bad as PGP exporters and
	other terrorists he keeps hearing about.
Johnny doesn't understand what it is exactly that money launderers do, 
	but if the government and the media say it's bad, then it must be 
	very very bad.
Johnny feels it must be even worse than what murderers and child molesters
	and cryptographers do. After all, his uncle says money launderers 
	stay in jail longer than murderers and child molesters, right?
Johnny feels, after all, crackheads and child molesters can't control what 
	they do, but people who keep money hidden away from the government,
	well, that's very, _VERY_ bad.
Johnny feels if there are too many money launderers, he might be forced to 
	have to use SmartCard to buy _his own_ strawberry-flavored condoms.
Johnny feels that would suck.

See Johnny's dad open a letter from his political party asking for
	contributions and investments for our children.
The politician writes to Johnny's dad that if Johnny's dad gives him enough
	investment capital, the politician will be elected, then he can form
	a bipartisan coalition of concerned politicians to finally declare 
	martial law to crack down on money launderers and other terrorists.
The politician says it is Johnny's dad's duty to contribute to the cause.
Johnny's dad writes a check for $999.99 made out to the Republicrat Peoples
	Party of America.
Johnny's dad delivers the check personally to the party office. He ran out 
	of stamps and doesn't like to go to the post office anyway for fear
	of getting shot.
The politician calls his buddy at the IRS.
Johnny's dad's scheduled audit is cancelled.
The check bounces.

The politician deposits the money in his Swiss bank account after routing it
	through multiple dummy corporations via cross-continent swaps and 
	a chain of wire-transfers performed by cut-out surrogates.
Strangely enough, during this time, the FINCEN Transactional Analysis 
	Software was down for maintenance.
So was INTERFIPOL's. How 'bout that?

Johnny's dad picks up the remote and starts to channel-surf. 
Johnny's dad's mistress is watching the Jerry Stringer show. Today's show
	is titled "A Dominatrix needs love too; a servant's Christmas guide
	to buying harnesses, dildos and lubricant for that special someone."

See Johnny's aunt go to the 24-7 to buy lottery tickets.
Johnny's aunt doesn't have a bank account and cashes her government checks 
	at a check cashing service. Johnny's aunt buys several money
	orders to send to distant relatives in the Czech Republic. FINCEN 
	goons suspect she is a money launderer.
Johnny's aunt buys a carton of cigarettes with her food stamps. She gets 
	into her old beater and drives off.
Johnny's aunt has a smile on her face.
At that moment a low-elevation spy satellite is passing over the 24-7.
A bored NSA spook is watching Johnny's aunt, too. He thinks to himself 
	'That Jerry Stringer show was much more interesting than this crap.
	If she's a money launderer, I'm Al Capone.'
Johnny's aunt wants to play bingo at the church fundraiser tonight. The 
	church is a thirty minute drive from the 24-7 if she gets on the 
	interstate. Since she doesn't have a TollCard, or a driver's 
	license for that matter, she decides to take the arterial roads.
Johnny's aunt is feeling very lucky.
She'll review her encrypted forwarded statements from Robber Barron Bank, 
	Grand Cayman branch, afterwards.

See Johnny's mommy stuff her face with cookies and cake.
See Johnny's mommy go to the instant-no-effort weight loss clinic.
See Johnny's mommy watch the nice network news anchor tell her about a new 
	approved breakthrough magic weight loss wonder drug pill.
See the nice multinational pharmaceutical's commercial promoting the 
	revolutionary miracle cure for those victimized by obesity. 
Johnny's mommy thinks, at last, I can stuff my face with all the munchies I 
	wanna eat, and still look thinner than a heroin junkie.
Johnny's mommy rolls her own joints.

See Johnny's sister pick up the remote. She starts to channel surf.
See Johnny's sister watch a breast-implant infomercial.

See Johnny's mommy pop two pen-pen pills.
Johnny's mommy needs heart surgery.
See the extremist doctor invent an effective treatment for pen-pen induced
	heart problems.
See the FDA not approve the treatment.
See the FDA helicopter gunships strafe the extremist terrorist doctor's 
	clinic and confiscate his property.
See Johnny's mommy get liposuction.
Johnny's mommy feels socialized medicine is a right. She is relieved to hear
	the government has dictated that liposuction is covered under her
	health plan since it is approved and not done for cosmetic reasons.

The government doctor that Johnny has a license to receive treatment from 
	has some very very disturbing news. While the super-duper-penicillin
	will probably kill off the super-penicillin resistant strain of
	syphilis he's picked up, there is an eight month waiting list for
	a week's supply at the government-run pharmacy. 
Even worse, the wonder drug that was supposed to be able to treat 
	that nasty rash on his private parts has been recalled
	because, although effective at removing herpes, it had the 
	unfortunate side effect of causing male reproductive organs to 
	shrivel up and fall off. 
Labeled "Lorena's Solution" by the press, several lawsuits are now pending.
	A spokesman for Cure My Willy LLC, had no comment.
'There's nothing more I can do except refer you to a qualified counselor."
	Johnny's assigned doctor said.

Something's wrong.
Johnny's depressed.
Life is tough these days what with all the drug-dealing gun-toting 
	money-laundering anonymous-remailing cash-using message-encrypting 
	mean-spirited insensitively-polluting insufficiently-contributing 
	pornography-consuming tax-evading conspiracy-theorizing 
	uncompassionate-hateful-moral-values-imposing 
	constitutionalist-reactionary-isolationist-survivalist 
	bomb-building-fertilizer-buying right-wing-fanatical terrorist cells
	running around out there tormenting Johnny and posing a threat to 
	all the other little children we must protect from harm.
Johnny's mommy is upset. It's not supposed to be this dangerous living in a
	social democracy like ours. Johnny's mommy decides to get involved. She forms
	She forms M.A.E.D.; Mothers Against Everything Dangerous.
Johnny's mommy is empowered now. Journalists quote her as an authoritative
	source when they write their stories. MAED is getting laws passed.
	Good things are happening.
But something's still wrong.
Johnny's still depressed. What could it be? He won't talk to me about it.
Johnny's mommy is frantic, she does what any decent responsible parent would
	do under the circumstances, Johnny's mommy e-mails her congressman:
NONE OF US ARE SAFE. DO SOMETHING. ANYTHING. MAKE IT GO AWAY! NOW!!!!

Johnny's therapist knows what's wrong with him.
He knows just what Johnny needs.
But lobotomies are not politically-correct.
So we'll put Johnny on Shitalin.
Johnny can cope now.
Ahhh, isn't Johnny adorable? Look how calm he is.

Johnny's goverment thinks Johnny is a model citizen. They'll pay for the 
Shitalin. Poorzac, too, if he wants it. No waiting list for those drugs.
Everyone knows we must all give up our freedom to protect The Children.
Anything for the Children. Like Johnny. We must make sacrifices jor Johnny.
There is too much freedom. And not enough protection for The Children.
If we don't do something now what does the future hold for all the Children?
Children are our most precious resource. The Children are the future.
Like Johnny... We can save them. Join MAED now won't you...

&gt;Encryption: Keep Feds' Nose Out Of The Net
&gt;By SEN. JOHN ASHCROFT
&gt;
&gt;     J. Edgar Hoover would have loved this. The Clinton administration wants
&gt;government to be able to read international computer communications -
&gt;financial transactions, personal e-mail and proprietary information sent
&gt;abroad - all in the name of national security. 
&gt;
&gt;In a proposal that raises obvious concerns about Americans' privacy,
&gt;President Clinton wants to give agencies the keys for decoding all exported
&gt;U.S. software and Internet communications. Such a policy also would tamper
&gt;with the competitive advantage that our U.S. software companies currently
&gt;enjoy in the field of encryption technology.
&gt;     Not only would Big Brother be looming over the shoulders of
&gt;international cybersurfers, he also threatens to render our state-of-the-art
&gt;computer software engineers obsolete and unemployed.
&gt;     Granted, the Internet could be used to commit crimes, and advanced
&gt;encryption could disguise such activity. However, we do not provide the
&gt;government with phone jacks outside our homes for unlimited wiretaps. Why,
&gt;then, should we grant government the Orwellian capability to listen at will
&gt;and in real time to our communications across the Web?
&gt;     The protections of the Fourth Amendment are clear. The right to
&gt;protection from unlawful searches is an indivisible American value.
&gt;     The president has proposed that American companies and computer users
&gt;supply the government with decryption keys to high-level encryption programs.
&gt;Yet European software producers are free to produce computer encryption codes
&gt;of all levels of security without providing keys to any government authority.
&gt;     Buyers of encryption software value security above all else. They will
&gt;ultimately choose airtight encryption programs - not those for which the U.S.
&gt;government maintains keys.
&gt;     In spite of this obvious fact, the president is trying to foist his
&gt;rigid policy on the exceptionally fluid and fast-paced computer industry.
&gt;Furthermore, recent developments in decryption technology cast doubt on the
&gt;wisdom of any government meddling in this industry.
&gt;     Two weeks ago, the 56-bit algorithm government standard encryption code
&gt;that protects most U.S. electronic financial transactions, from ATM cards to
&gt;wire transfers, was broken by a low-powered 90-megahertz Pentium processor.
&gt;     In 1977, when this code was first approved by the U.S. government as a
&gt;standard, it was deemed unbreakable. And for good reason - there are 72
&gt;quadrillion different combinations in a 56-bit code. However, with today's
&gt;technology, these 72 quadrillion different combinations can each be tried
&gt;-it's only a matter of time and determination.
&gt;     Two days after this encryption code was broken, however, the Senate
&gt;Commerce Committee voted, in accordance with administration policy, to force
&gt;American software companies to perpetuate this already compromised 56-bit
&gt;encryption system.
&gt;     Meanwhile, 128- bit encryption software from European firms is available
&gt;to every Web user. Interestingly, European firms can import this supersecure
&gt;encryption technology (originally developed by Americans) to the U.S., but
&gt;U.S. companies are forbidden by law from exporting these same programs to
&gt;other countries.
&gt;     So to move forward with the president's policy or the Commerce
&gt;Committee's bill would be an act of folly, creating a cadre of government
&gt;peeping Toms and causing severe damage to our vibrant software industries.
&gt;Government would be caught in a perpetual game of catch-up with whiz-kid
&gt;code-breakers and industry advances.
&gt;     Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., has signaled his objection to both
&gt;proposals. He and I would like to work to bring to the floor a version of the
&gt;encryption legislation by Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont. Burns' bill closely
&gt;resembles the popular House encryption bill sponsored by Rep. Bob Goodlatte,
&gt;R- Va. Both measures would not require sharing of keys with the goverment.
&gt;     In essence, these proposals would give U.S. encryption software
&gt;manufacturers the freedom to compete on equal footing in the worldwide
&gt;marketplace. They would set up a quasi-governmental board for the industry to
&gt;decide encryption bit strength based on the current level of international
&gt;technology.
&gt;     U.S. companies are on the front line of online technologies - the value-
&gt;added industries of the future.
&gt;     The best policy for encryption technology is one that can rapidly react
&gt;to breakthroughs in decoding capability and roll back encryption limits as
&gt;needed. The Burns and Goodlatte proposals would accomplish this. In contrast,
&gt;the Clinton administration's unnecessary and invasive interest in
&gt;international e-mail is a wholly unhealthy precedent, especially given this
&gt;administration's track record on FBI files and Internal Revenue Service
&gt;snooping.
&gt;     Every medium by which people communicate can be exploited by those with
&gt;illegal or immoral intentions. Nevertheless, this is no reason to hand Big
&gt;Brother the keys to unlock our e-mail diaries, open our ATM records or
&gt;translate our international communications.##

**************************************

EAT THE FOODS YOU LOVE

NO WILL POWER REQUIRED

**************************************

Anyone who has struggled to lose weight, like I did, 

can tell you DIETS ALONE DON'T WORK !  

That's because the difference between thin and overweight 

individuals has more to do with metabolic rate than what 

they eat.  It's believed most lean individuals have a

metabolism designed to BURN FAT !



We have designed a product that works

several ways to help you achieve maximum

results from your weight-loss program. This

unique blend of herbs, botanicals and Chromium

Picolinate, improves your metabolism so

your body relies more on stored fat and 

less on stored proteins.



"LOSE THE FAT....

       NOT THE MUSCLE"



Typically, up to 30% of lost weight is

muscle.  This lowers your metabolic rate and

slows calorie-burning.  This lowered metabolic

rate makes it hard to keep lost pounds from

creeping back.  Result: the "Yo-Yo" syndrome

in which weight is repeatedly lost and then 

regained.  After each lose-gain cycle the 

portion of fat increases.



To break this vicious cycle, it is important

to lose only fat while maintaining, or even 

increasing muscle.  Studies show that optimal

chromium nutrition is an effective part of long-term

fat-loss programs.  Our unique formula of 

specialized herbs and botanicals is coupled 

with the best source of chromium available,

patented Chromium Picolinate.



HERE'S EVIDENCE !



Several double-blind crossover studies

conducted along with clinical and laboratory

tests at a leading university and hospital have 

proven that the ingredients in this product are 

effective.



Without changing dietary or exercise

habits, over a six-week period, subjects in 

separate studies lost an average of 23% body fat or

approximately 4.4 lbs. of fat, and increased lean 

body mass by 1.5 lbs.



People over the age of 46 did even better,

and women seemed to do the best.  People

with elevated cholesterol levels averaged a 10%

drop in LDL cholesterol.



          WHAT EXACTLY IS 

      CHROMIUM PICOLINATE?



It's a bioactive chromium with clinically

proven benefits.  Chromium is vital to

good health and is essential for the efficient

functioning of insulin.  Poor responsiveness to 

insulin is common and is linked with increased

risk of being overweight, heart disease, elevated

blood fat, high blood presure and diabetes.



Over 90% of American diets provide much

less than the minimal amount of chromium

recommended by The National Academy

of Science.  Most forms of chromium are not

easily absorbed by the body, but chromium

picolinate, being bioactive, is easily absorbed.

In fact, it has been shown to reduce body fat,

lower cholesterol and even reduce elevated

block-sugar in diabetics.



THE DIET BREAKTHRU OF THE CENTURY !!



"Over the last 10 years, I have tried a variety of 

weight loss methods, spent thousands of dollars 

and failed at all of them.  By December 1995, I

was the heaviest I had ever weighed-235 lbs.

I had no energy.  My self-esteem had hit rock

bottom... I was introduced to Thermo Lift and 

have never looked back! My energy level has

boosted and my weight loss increased... In total

I have lost 70 lbs. and went from a size 22 to a

size 12.  The most amazing part - It's So Easy!"

Becky



"I began using Thermo-Lift the seventh week of 

gymnastics training to achieve a specific result: a

washboard stomach.  By the end of the eighth week

all I could see were solid stomach muscles!  I

recommend Thermo-Lift to all my muscle therapy

clientele for its superior fat burnng and muscle toning

abilities."   Chris



"I had tried everything to lose weight but nothing worked.

With Thermo-Lift I was amazed at how quickly I lost

weight - 4 pounds in 4 days! My energy level has 

sky rocketed and it's helped me curb my chocolate  

binges.  Thanks!!"       Gloria

Finally I figured, "Hey it will be IMPOSSIBLE to lose any money, so why not give it a shot... Was risking $20 worth the chance of making $50,000?"  78 days later (today), and I have made exactly 79,835.00
The crazy part is how EASY it has been!!!  No meetings, phone calls.  In fact, I didn't have to talk with anyone!!.  Just needed a computer and email!! Obviously from the condition of this email, I don't even know much about computers.  That's the beauty of it.  Anyone can do it.  This program is a proven mathematical formula. A PROVEN MATHEMATICAL FORMULA!!  This electronic multi-level marketing program works perfectly...100% EVERY TIME! Just follow the instructions (YOU CANT LOSE) and enjoy, enjoy, enjoy, and then spend spend spend!!!

p.s.  This program promises $50,000 profit.  I am well on my way to $100,000 and shooting for $150,000.00!! Good Luck!!! God Bless...  Remeber to drop me a note.  Can't wait to hear from you!!!!
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

You are about to make at least $50,000 in less than 90 days!  

Have you received this offer from someone else and deleted the message??
 
I DELETED THIS OPPORTUNITY 6 TIMES BEFORE GETTING INVOLVED!!! 

OVERVIEW OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY 
ELECTRONIC MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING PROGRAM

Basically, this is what we do:

We sell thousands of people a product for $5.00 that costs us next to nothing to produce and e-mail.  As with all multi-level businesses, we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products.  Every state in the U.S. allows you to recruit new multi- level business online (with your computer).

The product in this program is a series of four business and financial reports.  After you get started, people will order these reports from you.  Each $5.00 order you receive will include the e-mail address of the sender or a self addressed envelope of the sender.  To fill each order, you simply e-mail the product to the buyer or mail it off.   THAT'S IT!...the  $5.00 is yours!  This is the GREATEST electronic multi-level marketing business anywhere!  Here are the simple instructions and details on how to get 10,000 orders at minimum.  Send me a note sometime soon sharing your good fortunes!!!

FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY!
THE PROFITS ARE TREMENDOUS!!!
Remember the 4 points below and we'll see YOU at the top!


******* I  N  S  T  R  U  C  T  I  O  N  S *******

This is what you MUST do:

1.  Order all 4 reports listed and numbered from the list below.
     For each report send $5.00 CASH, A SELF ADDRESSED STAMPED BUSINESS      
     ENVELOPE, OR YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS    
    and YOUR RETURN POSTAL ADDRESS (in case of a problem) to each person   
     listed below. 

    When you order, make sure you request each SPECIFIC report.  You
    will need all four reports, because you will be reselling them and making big $$$.

2.  Replace the name and address under REPORT #1 (THAT'S ME!)  with your name 
     and address, moving my name and address under REPORT #2.  Move the name
     and address under REPORT #2 to under REPORT #3.  Move the name and address
     under REPORT #3 to under REPORT #4.  The name and address that was under
     REPORT #4 is dropped off the list and undoubtly is counting $50,000.
    
    IMPORTANT--DO NOT alter the names and addresses below, or their    
     sequence other than instructed in this program! Or you will not profit the way  
     you should.

    When doing this, please make certain you copy everyone's name and
    address ACCURATELY!!!  

3.  Take this entire program text, including the corrected names list,
    and save it on your computer.

4.  Now you're ready to start a massive advertising campaign on the
    WORLDWIDE WEB!  Advertising on the WEB is very, very inexpensive,
    but there are HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise also.  Another
    avenue which you could use is e-mail mailing lists.  You can buy
    these lists for under $20/20,000 addresses.  START sending this email to thousands 
    of people.  The sooner you do.  The sooner you will start to receive orders.

REQUIRED REPORTS

***Order each REPORT by NUMBER and NAME***

ALWAYS SEND  $5 CASH (Concealed) FOR EACH ORDER REQUESTING THE SPECIFIC REPORT BY NAME AND NUMBER. 

ALWAYS SEND FIRST CLASS OR PRIORITY MAIL AND PROVIDE A SELF ADDRESSED ENVELOPE AND YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS FOR QUICK DELIVERY.

HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PLAN WILL MAKE YOU $MONEY$
Let's say you decide to start small just to see how it goes.  Assume your goal is to get 10 people to participate on your first level. (Placing a lot of FREE ads on the internet could EASILY get a better response.)  Also assume that everyone else you recruit gets ONLY 10 downline members.  Follow this example for the STAGGERING results below.

1st level--your 10 members pay you $5                                  $50
2nd level-- those 10 members get 10 more (100 X $5)            $500
3rd level-- those 100 members get 10 more (1000 X $5)       $5,000
4th level-- those 1,000 get 10 more each (10,000 X $5)      $50,000
                                               THIS TOTALS-----------&gt; $55,550

Do you see how easy this is?  After you send out this same E Mail, your new recruits will order REPORT # 1 from you and move your name and address to #2.  Their recruits will order REPORT # 2 from you and move your name and address to number 3.  That group of recruits will order REPORT # 3 from you (a minimum of 1000 of $5 orders will come your way!) and move your name and address to number 4.  That group will order 10,000 copies of report #4 from you, AT MINIMUM!!

Remember friends, this is assuming that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each.  Dare to think for a moment what 
would happen if everyone got 20 people to participate!  Some people get 100's of recruits!  THINK ABOUT IT! By the 3rd and 4th level, your address will be on hundreds of thousands of emails.  Everyone of them wants to make money.  Every one has $5.00.

By the way, your cost to participate in this is practically nothing.You obviously already have an internet connection and email is FREE!!! REPORT#3 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing and purchasing email lists.

REMEMBER:  
Approx. 50,000 new people get online monthly!

ORDER YOUR REPORTS NOW!!!

It's so easy to listen to the critics who say Don't Do It.  Those people will never be successful.  Smile... and Enjoy!
  
*******YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINE*******

The check point that guarantees your success is simply this:
You MUST receive 10 to 20 orders for REPORT #1!  THIS IS A MUST!  If you don't within two weeks, advertise more and send out more programs until you do.  Then, a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for REPORT #2.  If you don't, advertise more and send out more programs until you do.  Once you have received 100, or more orders for REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because you will be on your way to the BANK!  -OR-  You can DOUBLE your efforts!

REMEMBER:  Every time your name is moved down on the list you are in front of a
                      DIFFERENT report, so you can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS 
                      by watching what report people are ordering from you. 

IT'S THAT EASY!!!


******* T  E  S  T  I  M  O  N  I  A  L  S *******

This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position, it won't work, you'll lose a lot of money.  I'm living proof that it works.  It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money, with little cost to you.  If you do choose to participate, follow the program exactly, and you'll be on your way to financial security.  If you are a fellow Christian and are in financial trouble like I was, consider this a sign.  I DID!
                                        Good Luck &amp; God Bless You,
                                        Sincerely, Chris Johnson

P.S.  Do you have any idea what 11,700 $5 bills ($58,500) looks like piled up on the kitchen table?...IT'S AWESOME!

My name is Frank.  My wife Doris and I live in Bel-Air, MD. I am a cost accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money.  When I received the program I grumbled to Doris about receiving "junk mail"!  I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved.  I "knew" it wouldn't work.  Doris totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet.  I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old "I told you so" on her when the thing didn't work... well, the laugh was on me!  Within two weeks she had received over 50 responses.  Within 45 days she had received over $147,200 in $5 bills! I was stunned.  I was sure that I had it all figured and that it
wouldn't work...I AM a believer now.  I have joined Doris in her "little" hobby.  I did have seven more years until retirement,  but I think of the "rat race" and it's not for me....
                                        Frank T., Bel-Air, MD

I just want to pass along my best wishes and encouragement to you.  Any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in.  I even checked with the U.S. Post Office to verify that the plan was legal.  It definitely is!  IT WORKS!!!
                                        Paul Johnson, Raleigh, NC

This is the only realistic money-making offer I've ever received.  I participated because this plan truly makes sense. I was surprised when the $5.00 bills started filling my mail box. By the time it tapered off I had received over 8,000 orders with over $40,000 in cash.  Dozens of people have sent warm personal notes too, sharing the news of their good fortunes!  It's been WONDERFUL.
                                        Carl Wittow Tulsa, OK

The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time.  I was approached several times before I checked this out.  I joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required.  Initially
I let no one in the organization know that I was an attorney and, to my astonishment, I received $36,470.00 in the first 14 weeks, with money still coming in.
                                Sincerely yours, Phillip A. Brown

This plan works like GANG-BUSTERS!!!  So far I have had 9,735 total orders...OVER $48,000!!!  I hope I have sparked your own excitement, if you follow the program exactly, you could have the same success I have, if not better.  Your success is right around the corner, but you must do a little work.
                                        Good Luck!  G. Bank

Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.  But conservative that I am I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back.  Boy I was surprised when I found my medium-size post office box crammed with orders.  After that it got so over-loaded that I had to start picking up my mail at the window.  I'll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before.  The nice thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where in the U.S. the people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return.

Mary Rockland, Lansing, MI

I had received this program before.  I deleted it, but later I wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try.  Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed another program...11 months passed then it came...I
didn't delete this one!...I made $41,000 on the first try!!

D. Wilburn, Muncie, IN

This is my third time to participate in this plan.  We have quit our jobs, and quite soon we will buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money.  The only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it.  For your sake, and for your family's sake don't pass up this golden opportunity.  Good luck and happy spending!
Charles Fairchild, Spokane, WA

Typically when I look at a money-making deal I want to know if the company is strong, will it be here when it's time for my big pay off.  In this crazy thing there is no company intervention for management to blow it.  Just people like me ordering directly from the source!  Interesting...I had a couple of projects I'd been trying to fund to no avail so I thought; Why not give it a try?  Well 2 1/2 weeks later the orders started coming in.  One project is funded and I'm sure the other will be soon!

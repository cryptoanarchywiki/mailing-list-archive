=============================================================          


Dear Friend:

We know how frustrating it is for most Online Marketers. 

You try and try, and just don't seem to get anywhere. 

And by anywhere, we mean...Make Money!

You see, we've discovered a few secrets that we're going to share
with you. 

Other people who already have this report found it helpful to
print it out, sit back and read it, and spend a little time
letting all of the ideas sort of sink in.

We assure you, if you'll take just a few minutes to really
concentrate on what we've given you here, you'll find this
invaluable and worth tens of thousands of dollars
(or more) to you.

Anyway, that's all for now...print it out, spend a few minutes
with it and look it over.

But first, let me tell you a little story...
          
Right now there are over forty million people surfing the Internet. 
By the year 2000, that figure is expected to more than double.
With so many people using the Internet, smart "net"repreneur's are
taking advantage of what this new (in terms of true commercial 
application) and exciting medium has to offer.

The Internet presents one of the best ways to make money that has
ever been introduced. On any given day you have the opportunity to 
reach more people than most cities have population wise. This is the 
reason so many businesses are scrambling to make their presence 
known on the Internet. 

Being "online" offers a person the ability to reach multitudes 
of people from all over the world.  It also offers, to those who
know how, THE ABILITY TO MAKE EXCELLENT MONEY. And we
do mean excellent money!!!

CONSIDER THIS POSSIBILITY:  You wake up in the morning and you 
put on a pot of coffee. As you sip on your cup of hot "brew" you saunter 
over and turn your computer on. Then, as your monitor glows from dim to 
bright, you find that you have inquiries from all sorts of people requesting 
what you have to offer. Later, after you have finished reading your
inquiries, you stroll out to your mailbox. You find it is filled with letters from
people from all across the world! What's even better though, is that the letters 
are FILLED WITH MONEY; cash, checks, and money orders. Then, after 
tallying up the totals, you find that you have made anywhere between 
$200 to $1,000 and it isn't even one o'clock in the afternoon. 
 
Think of it: NO boss, NO traffic, and NO annoying Co-workers. Wouldn't
it feel great to wake up in the morning knowing you were going to be 
making excellent money but didn't have to leave your house to do it!?! 
Wouldn't your life be far less complicated?

The truth is, you can also be one of those who become financially
independent via the Internet. AND THE BEST PART IS...IT DOESN'T 
REQUIRE A LOT OF MONEY!!

What it does require is the knowledge of how, what, and where to 
do it. And that is where we can help. We can provide you with the 
knowledge of how to begin earning substantial income from your 
computer via the "information superhighway".   

And just so you know- THIS IS NOT A MLM, AND NO YOU DON'T 
WORK FOR US! YOU DO WHATEVER YOU CHOOSE! We just provide 
you with the information of how to make MONEY online. 
Even if you are unsure as to what to do, we will provide you 
with ideas for the some of the best online businesses and the secrets of 
bulk emailing.

Throughout a year of trial and error, we have found the best tools to 
begin a successful money making Internet business.  We will show you 
how to start with very little money and yet achieve maximum results.  Our 
information includes suggestions on some of the best places you
should be investing your money as well as how to get the most impact for
your dollar.  The report provides you with information crucial to your future
business growth as an "online" company.  We will provide you with a number 
of the critical tools you need to begin a highly profitable business from your
own computer.

This is a wonderful opportunity, we urge you to take advantage of it.
You won't find too many people that will give away ALL of their secrets!!
The majority of the people today, who are rich, have copied what someone
else is or has been doing.  That is what we are offering you now--a chance
to copy our success!!  It is very easy and we ARE for REAL!

Sound too good to be true?  That's what others have said.  That is, until they
Received their kit and saw for themselves just how easy it is to make money
On the net!


Hi NI,

I received your report and free bonuses last Saturday and wanted to 
congratulate you on a job well done. I read through your report "How 
To Profit From The Internet" and I'm very impressed.  I have bought 
other books and manuals about Online Marketing, Direct Marketing, 
E-mail, Mail Order, etc. Yours is the only one that explains the subject 
in a easy to understand language.  I finally found the secrets I've been
looking for. 

Once again, Great Job!

Sincerely,

John Strand - Satisfied Customer



My late father always told me, "remember, Michele, there is no free
lunch in life.  You get out of life what you put into it."  Through
trial and error and a somewhat slow frustrating start, I purchased your
report and finally figured out how to start a very profitable business from 
my home. Your report is great, you give the average person the tools and 
secrets to succeed.  I know my dad would have been very proud of me.
I can't thank you enough =)

Michele B from Oregon

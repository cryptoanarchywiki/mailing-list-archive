We placed an ad in one small area of the Internet.  And when

COLORADO  MARKETING  FIRM  SHARES  MONEY
GENERATING  TRADE  SECRETS  ON  THE  INTERNET!
-----------------------------------

Hello,

My Name is Shannon Johnson.  I am CEO of LC Enterprises.  
I have to tell you that I am really angry and upset about 
what is going on here on the Internet.  We at Success 
Concepts are so angry, in fact, that we decided to do something
about it.  Read on and you'll see.

For three years I have lead my marketing firm in sales campaigns on
the Internet and the other large online services which have yielded
outstanding results!  We are now sharing the information we have
gained over the last several years with other people who are 
desperately trying to figure out how to make a substantial income 
from their home computers.

Do you know what it's like to turn your computer on in the morning to
find an email box full of orders for your product.....Where it takes 
over an hour to sift through just the credit card orders alone?
We do!

Do you know what it's like to have the postman bring you a bag full 
of orders for products you have marketed on the Internet, and then 
hear him complain about all the mail you get?
We do!

Do you know what it's like to place a simple ad into a newsgoup or
classified section on the Internet and have your Order Department's
phone ring off the hook with people who want to buy your product.
We do!

Have you ever placed just one advertisement on the Ineternet and when
the dust settled ten days later had over 6,000 responses by phone,
fax, mail, and email?
Well....we did in January of this year!

Have you ever tried to market something simple on the Internet, only
to have weeks or months of toil and effort result in only a few 
sales, if any?
Well....that's happened to us too.  But not since we learned the 
secrets!!!

You see, we found the "secrets" to marketing just about anything on
the Internet.  And it is really quite simple, once you know them.

Imagine this.  You decide to make a second, or even a primary
income from the Internet.  So, you put up a Web Site, get a mess
of email follow-up letters ready, put your Web Site in several 
hundred search engines (people gotta find your page...right), get in 
the News-Groups and advertise your site, and drop hundreds of 
classified ads all over the Net.  There ya go.....now you are going 
to rake in the cash!
Two weeks later you have one sale and you are telling your spouse
and your friends that "This will take time! "  Four months later 
you've made just enough to pay for your web space and your friends 
don't listen to you anymore.  They consider you an "Internet Marketer
Wanna Be".  Sound familiar!

We are not trying to rub salt in your wounds.  What we are trying to
do is let you in on the TRUTH about doing business from your home
on the Internet. Let's face it.  The vast majority of people who are
trying to earn a living on the Internet are STARVING!!!  That's 
right! They don't have a clue of what to do first, second, third or 
fourth!  And even if they do have a clue they have been lead down the 
garden path with dreams and silly techniques which don't work and are 
breaking the hearts of thousands of people who are just trying to 
make a living from their home computers.  That is what we are so 
upset about at Success Concepts!

But, it doesn't have to be that way!  People don't have to really 
FAIL at making a good income on the Internet.  And it really doesn't 
have to take months or even years to learn how to do it.  Not if you 
have the right guide to show you what to do, and when to do it.

    THE GUIDE  (No More Broken Dreams on The Internet)

is the name of our informative guide to generating orders, money, 
cash, on the Net.  It was written with the "average" Netrepreneur in 
mind, in plain English, with straight to the point "How To" and "Why 
Do You Do" phraseology.

In......

    THE GUIDE  (No More Broken Dreams on The Internet)

we expose all the traps WE fell into in our first year of Internet 
Marketing, but stay away from now.  We expose the lies and half 
truths which people have fallen for in the past.  We expose the 
SECRETS which most of the successful Internet Marketers really DON'T 
WANT YOU TO KNOW! Because, when you know the secrets you will be off 
and running in... that's right......THEIR BACKYARD....the Cyberspace 
Marketplace!

THERE IS ROOM FOR A LOT MORE OF US!

There are millions of people on the Internet.  And there are millions
of more people on the way here.  The pie which will be cut up is
so huge that several hundred more people who know what they are
doing will not even make a dent in our income level. It will just be 
a drop in the bucket so to speak.

    THE GUIDE  (No More Broken Dreams on The Internet)

will expose the Ineternet for what it really is, the marketplace 
which can provide you with a steady income.  It will literally show 
you what to do first, second, third, fourth, and so on.

You are about to discover exactly what makes the difference between
the "Internet success stories," and the obscure "Web Marketing 
Failures."

This guide will give you all the details, the tools,  the ideas, and 
the resources to help you make all of your INTERNET DREAMS come 
true...

Finally, the truth is revealed!  Find out the secrets that some of 
the wealthiest Internet marketers are using to propel their sales 
through the Cyberspace roof.

    THE GUIDE  (No More Broken Dreams on The Internet)

Will show you:

** How to use Newsgroups to your advantage.  The tricks!
    Just placing a few ads just won't do it for you!

** How to use a sig file to get more orders.  They look simple, but 
    if you write your Sig correctly it can be a GOLD MINE to you. We 
    generate thousands just from our sigs!

** How to place your web page at the top of the search engines.
If you don't get close to the top you can forget many hits!

** How to maximize your web sales using a professional looking web 
page (that you can build all by yourself).

** All about follow-ups and how to do them using email.
A very simple technique which can mean rapidly increasing volume to
you.  This technique is used by some of the top Internet Marketers.

** How to effectively build mailing lists on the internet.
Without lists your business will probably perish!

** Special Coding Techniques which can make your Marketing efforts
amaze even the most die hard skeptics

** Where and how to place thousands of FREE classified ads.
What to say in them, and what to expect when you place them.

** What products you should or shouldn't market for quick results

** How to use Testimonials...

** The importance of tracking your marketing results.

** The importance of a "back-end".

** A step by step guide to get you started IMMEDIATELY!

** And much, much more...

Here is what some people who turned their Internet Marketing
results from failure to success have to say about "The Guide":

I thought all I had to do was place some classified ads on the Net 
for my flame retarding spray.  Every night after work I would place a
few ads and answer some questions in email.  I never made much
money at all.  Then I read THE GUIDE and everything turned around!
I'm looking at leaving my job now.  And their newsletter keeps me up
to date with all the new things I need to know to keep on track with
my business.

I started Internet Marketing in the Chat Rooms on AOL.  What
a joke that was!  Nobody ever told me it would take so long to
make any money that way.  Then I read the 'The Guide." The
Chat Rooms, Internet Newsgroups, Web Sites, and email all
make me money now.  And it wasn't all that hard either.  I just
didn't know the secrets before.  But I do now!!!  The Internet is
huge, and I've just started getting my share!

    THE GUIDE  (No More Broken Dreams on The Internet)

is usually only offered to our marketing clients.  With all the 
garbage we have seen on the Internet in the past few months we have 
decided to offer "The Guide" to everyone reading this advertisement.  
Our clients have paid $99.95 for "The Guide" and have felt that it 
was a real bargain for that price.  "The Guide" has now gone into it 
SECOND Edition and we feel that we should open it up to just about 
anyone's financial budget. At least for a limited time.

    THE GUIDE  (No More Broken Dreams on The Internet)

is being offered to you, for a limited time, for only $24.95!!!  
That's correct!  That's a full $75 off the regular price.  Once 200 
more or so orders have been placed at this price we will take "The 
Guide" off of the sale counter and move the price back to $99.95.  
But, why offer this for such a deep discount?  It's simple.  Success 
Concepts feels that the time is right for this information to become 
more available on the Net.  But we aren't marketing fools either. The 
Guide holds a Copyright, and will only be offered at this very deeply 
discounted price for a very limited time.

(There is some Joker on the Net who is trying to sell LESS 
information without our two bonus offers to follow for $395.00.  That 
is ridiculous!!!)

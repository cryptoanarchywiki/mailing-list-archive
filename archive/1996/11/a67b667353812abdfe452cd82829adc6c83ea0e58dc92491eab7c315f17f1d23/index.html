New Information Resource Assists in Tracking Domestic Flights

(ENN) A free service called "Flight Trax" is now available on the
World-Wide-Web.
This  new information resource allows one to track the progress of any
domestic airflight within the contigious 48 states.

Call up:  http://www.amerwxcncpt.com/ with your favorite internet
browser. The program will ask you for the flight number, the airline, and=
 the destination airport (using the FAA designated three-letter code). The=
 program will
then show you the kind of aricraft used, its flight's path, its location
on that path (accurate to within two or three minutes), and its expected
time of arrival at its destination. It will not tell you why it may have
been delayed.

The information is provided by Flyte-Comm of Ft. Lauderdale, FL, which
uses data from the FAA to produce the flight estimates.  Might be prove
useful while waiting for Grandma's flight to come in from Des Moines, or
a variety of other uses.

This is it! 
THE MOST PHENOMENAL WEALTH-BUILDING BONANZA IN HISTORY. 
A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for you to upgrade the
quality of your life forever. 
Your chance to automatically capitalize on the historic 
outpouring of humanity on to the Internet. 
(It will only happen once ... and it's happening RIGHT NOW!)
Take just four minutes to discover the secret that WILL
IMMEDIATELY CHANGE YOUR LIFE. (Do you *really* have
something else to do more important than THAT?)
You are about to embark upon a wonderful journey to amass a
small fortune in a short time. (Even a LARGE fortune, if you
choose to devote some effort.) It's easy and fail proof. All you
have to do is take the first step. You've paid your dues; you
deserve it. Now it's your turn.
WITHIN 90 DAYS, YOU'LL HAVE MORE THAN $50,000
... and that's just the beginning!

HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? Simple: To begin with, realize that there
were only about two-million Internet "host sites" in 1994 --
yet that number had soared to around 20 million by the end of
1997. In other words, the rate of Internet growth is geometric
-- like 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. And, for the moment, even THAT
rate is accelerating.
Now, the most famous example of a host site is aol.com,
America Online(tm). It, by itself, has over ten-million people
as members. (Not all host sites have members, though.)
HERE'S THE IMPORTANT PART:
Following the present trend, the number of host sites will
skyrocket to nearly ONE HUNDRED MILLION during 1998. And
that's just the host sites! Now, imagine how many individual
PEOPLE are rushing on line for the first time ... right now
... this very instant.
This creates tremendous opportunity for you. But there's no time
to waste! (How long can THAT growth rate continue? Oh, sure,
it will keep growing -- just not at the historic 1998 rate.)
IF YOU'RE WAITING FOR YOUR SHIP TO COME IN, THIS IS IT.
(Don't let it sail away without you.)
So here it is, the easiest money-generating system you'll ever
hear about. One that's showing extraordinary appeal to an
ever-expanding mass of people who feel the need for additional
income. And YOU can help them fulfill that need.
HERE'S YOUR CHANCE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
HOW? In short, by developing a mailing list of people who need
extra money. (I know: it doesn't seem very exciting yet, but
keep reading.) And people will pay you to be on your list. A LOT
of people. (See: it's already starting to sound better.) Let's
go through it step by step so you'll know exactly what to do ...
and why (Step #4!) so many people feel hope again.
If you've seen a lot of posts like this, you already have PROOF
that THIS SYSTEM WORKS.
____________________STEP 1._________________
You will need these instructions later; so save them on your
hard drive. (FILE then SAVE. If you have a choice, choose a
"text" or "ASCII" file type.) Now print these instructions so
you can read them more easily. (Go ahead, I'll wait for you ...)
____________________STEP 2._________________
This is the step where you invest money. Less than $10. (Try not
to cry.) About the same as the price of a movie ticket, or a
12-pack of beer, or a few lottery tickets. In this "lottery,"
however, YOU control the results.
YOU CANNOT AFFORD *NOT* TO DO THIS.
On a sheet of paper, write "Processing fee to add me to your
mailing list". (You, too, are one of those people wanting extra
income, aren't you? Besides, the inherent value of being on that
mailing list is what makes this a legal program. [The relevant
American laws are in the United States Code, Title 18, 1302,
1341, and 1342.])
Fold the sheet around a US $1 bill. Mail this to the List Manager
in Position A, located at the end of these instructions. Double-
check the postage for any mail going outside your country.
Repeat that for the other List Managers.
___________________STEP 3.__________________
Use Notepad (preferably) or some other word processor to open
the file you saved in Step 1. Scroll to the List Managers
section. Delete the name and address under Position F. Move the
name and address from Position E down to Position F. Then, in
order, move each of the others down one until Position A is left
vacant. That's where your name and address go! Double check your
address: whatever is there is where all your money will go. Save
the file. (If you don't have Notepad, be sure to save it as an
"ASCII" or "text" file.)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~        NOW, HERE'S THE MAGIC PART . . .
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
____________________STEP 4._________________
THIS STEP MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD. It's also where
you invest a little time. As much as four hours, if you use
America Online. (Try not to cry.) If it'll be easier on you,
take an hour per day. Skip those X Files episodes you've already
seen twice. In THIS show, YOU control the ending.
All those people coming on line for the first time. Nearly
TWO-THOUSAND NEW PEOPLE PER DAY
... and growing! Where do they go?
Sooner or later --but usually immediately-- they go to the
newsgroups. Isn't that where YOU discovered this opportunity?
Over 40,000 newsgroups, now, and that's growing, too. (There's
a list of 49,000 at ftp://ftp.alt.net/pub/news/active.)
So, simply take the file you saved in Step 3 and post it to some
newsgroups. Three hundred, to be precise. (How? See below.)
How many people will be exposed to your offer during the two
weeks your post will remain in the newsgroup? Depending on how
you choose the newsgroups, anywhere from 10,000 to
OVER A MILLION PEOPLE WILL SEE YOUR OFFER.

The implications of that are down right staggering. Even more
so than it might seem! (See the Example section, below --
especially the first and last paragraphs.)
___________________STEP 5.__________________
Now begins the greatest money-making exprience of your life!
In about a week, you start receiving requests and processing
fees from opportunity seekers around the world. And they all
want to be added to your mailing list.
WHY do they want to do this? Well, for the most of the same
reasons YOU want to do this!
What will you do with all those requests? It's up to you. For
example, you can sell them to professional list brokers, found
in the Yellow Pages, who will see that offers are sent out.
You can take up exotic-stamp collecting. To some of the
addresses, you might even send these instructions: Most people
want to jump right back in again as soon as their name moves out
of Position F; after all, they already KNOW how well this works!
And, what will you do with all that money? That, also, is up to
you. (You can think of something, can't you?)
____________________________________________
                    Example

This example assumes that you post, one time, to just 300
newsgroups, with an average readership of merely 100 people
during the dozen days your message stays on file. It assumes
that VIRTUALLY EVERYONE --9,998 out of every 10,000 potential
readers-- does NOT even see your opportunity, does NOT read
it, or is already involved or, in any case, does NOT take any
action.
In marketing terms, this assumes a response rate of merely one
fiftieth of one percent (0.0002). That's considered almost no
response at all! (NOW can you see why this works so well?)
You in Position A:
Only 6 respond to your efforts.               6 x $1 =      $6
You in Position B:
Only 6 respond to each of the 6 in A.        36 x $1 =     $36
You in Position C:
Only 6 respond to each of the 36 in B.      216 x $1 =    $216
You in Position D:
Only 6 respond to each of the 216 in C.   1,296 x $1 =  $1,296
You in Position E:
Only 6 respond to each of the 1296 in D.  7,776 x $1 =  $7,776
You in Position F:
Only 6 respond to each of the 7776 in E. 46,656 x $1 = $46,656
                                                       _______
                                          Your income  $55,986
If, however, these people each get a mere 8 responses (out of
30,000 people!), your income increases to well over a quarter
of a million dollars!
PEOPLE ARE TRULY ACCOMPLISHING THIS. RIGHT NOW! *WHY NOT YOU?*
How? The details are in your hands this very instant. THAT'S IT.
All you have to do is actually begin.
You may even wish to try for 20 people. You literally won't
believe how much THAT produces. So, do the numbers for yourself.
(I'll give you two hints: a. For ten, it's 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x
10 x 10 = $1,000,000. b. Have you heard of a "sixty-four million
dollar question"?) You just might end up wanting to spend a few
DAYS posting, and to take it to a few of your friends. But start
-- start today -- and start with just 300 newsgroups.
THIS IS THE MOMENT YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.
__________How To Post To Newsgroups_________
To post, just "cut and paste": Highlight the entire text of
these instructions. Choose EDIT then COPY. You only need to do
that once. Here's the part you repeat: Go to the newsgroup.
Click on Send New Message, Post Article, To News, or whatever
applies. Type your headline in the Subject box. (Some subject
heading samples are listed below.) Go to the Message box. Paste
these instructions by holding down your Ctrl key while you
depress the letter V. Click on Send, OK, or whatever is there.
STEP-BY-STEP DIRECTIONS FOR AMERICA ONLINE: Go on line. Click on
the Internet globe at the bottom of your Welcome page. Edit the
Web Address window to read --without the quotes--
"http://members.aol.com/TouchMidas/private/aol-gold.txt". Click
on Go To The Web. When you see the directions, print them out by
clicking on the printer icon at the top of your screen. (If you
receive a "URL Not Found" error, carefully re-type the address.
If the it seems to have been discontinued, try this address:
"http://home1.gte.net/docthomp/AOL.htm".)

********************************************
Maybe things like this never work for you? (You are surely
correct ... unless you're already grabbing an envelope.) You
tried something like this before? (Have you *REALLY* ever
reached 30,000 people before?) Maybe you'll only get $10,000?
(Life is cruel.) Maybe you're already making $2,000 per hour?
Maybe nobody else will do this? (Look around the newsgroups:
they already ARE doing this. How much proof do you need?) Then,
maybe everyone else is already doing this? (Definitely NOT!
But you'll END UP being right if you keep putting this off.)
"I'll do it later, really!" (Yeah, right.) Maybe the Easter
Bunny will change your life, so you won't have to bother? Is
the price of a movie ticket truly more important than your
future?
GO FOR THE GOLD: What have you got to lose?

        and the money will pour in!

________________________________________________
This is a true story! Esta historia es Real!

Das atrs, cuando "navegaba" por estas pginas de Newsgroups, 
as mismo como Ud. lo esta haciendo ahora, se me apareci un artculo 
similar a este que deca que uno puede ganar miles de dlares en pocas 
semanas con una inversin de $6.00!. Enseguida pens, "Oh no! otra 
estafa ms?", pero como la mayora de nosotros, la curiosidad pudo 
ms, y segu leyendo.
Y segua diciendo que Ud. enviar $1.00 a cada uno de los 6 nombres y 
direcciones mencionados en este artculo. Entonces Ud. anota su nombre 
y direccin al final de la lista reemplazando al #6, y enve o ponga 
este artculo a por lo menos 200 "Newsgroups"(Hay miles de estos en 
todo el mundo).

Ningn truco, eso fue todo. La gran diferencia entre este sistema y 
otros es que Ud. tiene una lista de 6 en vez de 5... Esto significa 
que su promedio de ganancia ser aproximadamente 15 veces mayor!!!
Despus de pensarlo una y otra vez, y consultar con unos amigos 
primero, decid probarlo. Pens que lo nico que podra perder eran 6 
estampillas y $6.00, verdad?.
Como probablemente muchos de nosotros, estaba un poco preocupado por 
la legalidad de todo esto. Entonces consult en las oficinas del 
Correo Central y me confirmaron que en realidad era legal!! .
Entonces invert mis $6.00......IMAGNENSE QU!!!...a los 7 das, 
empec a recibir dinero por correo!!!.
Estaba sorprendido! todava pensaba esto terminar enseguida, y no 
pens ms en otra cosa. Pero el dinero segua llegando. En mi primera 
semana hice unos $20.00 a $30.00 dlares. Para el final de la segunda 
semana tenia hecho un total de ms de $1,000.00!!!!! En la tercera 
semana recib ms de $10,000.00 y todava segua llegando ms. 
Esta es mi cuarta semana ya hice un total de ms de $41,000.00 y 
esto sigue llegando ms rpidamente(mi esposa e hijos se pasan abriendo los
sobres y yo consiguiendo "Newsgroups"). Esto se puso serio!!!! Todo esto
realmente vali la inversin de $6.00 y 6 estampillas. Me gastaba ms que
esto en sorteos y loteras!! 

Permtanme explicarles como funciona esto y lo ms importante el por 
qu funciona....tambin, Ud. asegrese de imprimir una copia de este 
artculo AHORA, para poder sacar toda la informacin a medida que lo 
necesite. El proceso es muy fcil y consiste en 3 pasos sencillos: 

PASO No. 1: Obtenga 6 hojas de papel y escriba en cada una de ellas:
"FAVOR DE INCLUIRME EN SU LISTA DE CORRESPONDENCIA O E-MAIL".
Ahora consiga 6 billetes de US$1.00 dlar e introduzca cada dlar en 
un sobre con la hoja de manera que el billete no se vea a travs del 
sobre!! Mejor ponerlo encerrado en un papel de color oscuro para 
prevenir robos de correspondencia. 

**OPCIONAL: Mande una tarjeta postal de su ciudad o pas.

Ahora Ud. debera tener 6 sobres sellados y en ellos un papel con la 
frase mencionada, su nombre y direccin, y un billete de $1.00 dlar. 
Lo que Ud. esta haciendo con esto es crear un "servicio" y eso hace 
que esto sea ABSOLUTAMENTE LEGAL!!

Enviar los 6 sobres a las siguientes direcciones:

#6 A. Alvarez

PASO NO. 2: Ahora elimine el #1 de la lista de arriba y mueva los 
otros nombres un nmero para arriba (el #6 se convierte en #5, 
el #5 se convierte en #4, Etc.) y agregue SU NOMBRE y direccin como 
el #6 en la lista.

PASO No. 3: Cambie todo lo que crea conveniente de este artculo, 
pero trate de mantenerlo lo ms posible cercano al original. Ahora 
ponga su artculo en por lo menos 200 "Newsgroups"(existen ms 
de 24,000 grupos).
Solo necesita 200, pero cuando ms cantidad lo ponga, ms dinero le 
llegar!!!.

________________________________________________________

ES TODO!. Todo lo que tiene que hacer es meterse en diferentes 
"Newsgroups" y empastarlos, cuando ya tenga prctica, solo le 
tomar unos 30 segundos por cada newsgroup!
**RECUERDE, CUANTOS MS NEWSGROUPS CONSIGA, MS RESPUESTAS (Y DINERO)
RECIBIR!! PERO DEBE DE ENTRAR EN POR LO MENOS 200**
YA ESTA!!!.... Ud. estar recibiendo dinero de todo el mundo, de 
lugares que ni conoce y en unos pocos das!. Eventualmente querr 
rentar un P.O.Box por la cantidad de sobres que ir recibiendo.

**ASEGRESE DE QUE TODAS LAS DIRECCIONES ESTEN CORRECTAS

Ahora el POR QU de todo esto:

#6 - De 200 enviados, digamos que recibo solo 5 respuestas 
(bajsimo ejemplo).
Entonces hice $5.00 con mi nombre en la posicin #6 de esta carta.
#5 - Ahora, cada uno de las 5 personas que ya me enviaron los 
$1.00 tambin hacen un mnimo 200 Newsgroups, cada uno con mi 
nombre en el #5 de la lista y solo responden 5 personas a cada 
uno de los 5 originales, esto hace $25.00 ms que yo recibo
#4 - Ahora estas 25 personas pone un mnimo de 200 Newsgroups 
con mi nombre en el #4 y solo se recibe 5 respuestas de cada uno. 
Estara haciendo otros $125.00 adicionales.
#3 - Ahora esta 125 personas ponen sus mnimo de 200 grupos con 
mi nombre en el #3 y solo recibe 5 respuestas cada una, yo recibo 
un adicional de $625.00!.
#2 - OK, aqu esta la parte ms divertida, cada una de estas 625 
personas ponen sus cartas en otros 200 grupos con mi nombre en el 
#2 y cada una recibe solo 5 respuestas, esto hace que yo reciba 
$3,125.00!!!. 
#1 - Estas 3,125 personas enviarn este mensaje a un mnimo de 
200 Newsgroups con mi nombre en el #1 y si solo 5 personas 
responden de los 200 grupos, estar recibiendo $15,625.00!!.

De una inversin original de $6.00!! ms estampillas. FABULOSO! 
Y como dije antes, que solo 5 personas respondan muy poca, el 
promedio real seria 20 o 30 personas!. Asique pongamos estos 
nmeros a calcular.

Si solo 15 personas responden, esto hace:
en la #6 $15.00
en la #5 $225.00
en la #4 $3,375.00
en la #3 $50,625.00
en la #2 $759,375.00
en la #1 $11,390,625.00

Una vez que su nombre ya no esta en la lista, saque el ultimo 
anuncio del Newsgroup y enve otros $6.00 a los nombres en esa 
lista, poniendo su nombre en el #6 y repetir todo el proceso. 
Y empezar a ponerlos en los Newsgroups otra vez.
Lo que debe recordar es que miles de personas ms, en todo el 
mundo, se conectan al Internet cada da y leern estos artculos 
todos los das como USTED Y YO LO HACEMOS!!!. 

As que creo nadie tendra problemas en invertir $6.00 y ver si 
realmente esto funciona. Algunas personas llegan a pensar..."y 
si nadie decide contestarme?"
Que!! Cul es la chance de que esto pas cuando hay miles y 
miles de personas honestas (que como nosotros) buscan una manera 
de tener independencia financiera y pagar cuentas!!!., y estan 
dispuestas a tratar, pues "No hay peor lucha de la que no se hace". 
Se estima que existen de 20,000 a 50.000 nuevos usuarios TODOS LOS DIAS!
(en todo el mundo)

*******************************************
OTRO SISTEMA PARA COMUNICARSE ES CONSIGUIENDO E-MAIL DE PERSONAS 
PARTICULARES, DEBE SER POR LO MENOS 200 DIRECCIONES, Y ESTO TIENE 
UNA EFECTIVIDAD DE MINIMO 5% AL 15%. SI SOLO BUSCAN PERSONAS QUE 
HABLAN ESPAOL, VAYAN A UN PROVEEDOR DE E-MAILS E IMPRIMAN UN 
APELLIDO LATINO Y YA.

Recuerde de hacerlo esto en forma CORRECTA, LIMPIA Y HONESTAMENTE 
y funcionar con toda seguridad. Solamente tiene que ser honesto. 
Asegrese de imprimir este artculo AHORA, Trate de mantener la 
lista de todos los que les envan dinero y siempre fjese en los 
Newsgroups y vea si todos estn participando limpiamente. 
Recuerde, HONESTIDAD ES EL MEJOR MTODO.
No se necesita hacer trucos con la idea bsica de hacer dinero en esto!
BENDICIONES PARA TODOS, y suerte, juguemos limpio y aprovechar 
esta hermosa oportunidad de hacer toneladas de dinero con el Internet.

**Dicho sea de paso, si Ud. defrauda a las personas poniendo 
mensajescon su nombre y no enva ningn dinero a los dems en 
esa lista, Ud. recibir casi NADA!.

He conversado con personas que conocieron personas que hicieron 
eso y solo llegaron a colectar unos $150.00, y eso despus de unas 
7 semanas!.

Algunos decidieron probar otra vez, haciendo correctamente, y en 
4 a 5 semanas recibieron ms de $10.000. Esto es la ms limpia y 
honesta manera de compartir fortuna que yo jams haya visto, 
sin costarnos mucho excepto un poco de tiempo. El TIEMPO ES 
IMPORTANTE!, no dejar pasar ms de 7 das del momento que vea 
este artculo!. Tambin puede conseguir lista de E-MAIL para 
obtener dinero extra.
Sigamos todos las reglas del negocio!

Recuerde mencionar estas ganancias extras en sus declaraciones 
de impuestos. 

Gracias otra vez y BENDICIONES A TODOS!!

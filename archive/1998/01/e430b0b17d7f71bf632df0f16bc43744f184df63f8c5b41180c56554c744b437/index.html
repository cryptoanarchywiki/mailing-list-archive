                    Submission Deadline:  January 15, 1998

           "The challenges of incident handling in a diverse world"


The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) was formed in
November 1990 to address the problem of an ever increasing number of
computer and network security related incidents, affecting thousands of
systems around the world. The forum is made up of government, private and
academic Computer Security Incident Response Teams from around the world.
Its primary goal is to coordinate the efforts of its members in order to

increase both their individual and collective effectiveness.

The annual Incident Handling Workshop is part of FIRST's ongoing
educational
program, which is aimed at increasing the general awareness of security
issues and improving expertise when handling computer security incidents.

Specific security problems can affect many individuals and organizations

around the world, possibly involving many different technological
environments. Each of the parties involved must tailor its actions to the
context in which the problem is experienced. Factors which must be taken

into account include:

 * Cultural: The way in which a problem is tackled can be highly
influenced
   by the historical development of the community in question. Examples
   are the ability for open communication about problems or values
regarding
   privacy.

 * Professional: Today the Internet is open to the masses. The ease of
   communication, the advent of electronic commerce, and the
availability of
   information, makes it a playground and a library for the masses. It is
   also a key business tool which professionals depend upon.

 * Political: Political decisions of individual countries concerning key

   areas of computer security, e.g. restrictions in the use and export of
   cryptological technology, may change the way that security problems
   must be approached. Legalities pertaining to diverse use of computer
   systems vary widely between countries.

 * Technological: Different technologies, covering a wide spectrum that
   includes mainframes, unix workstations, personal computers and network
   computers are connected to the same network simultaneously.


Who should attend?
__________________

All those responsible for any aspect of computer security management will
benefit from attending this workshop. This includes both members and
non-members of FIRST, law enforcement officials, computer security
incident
response teams, as well as consultants, contractors, vendors and
individuals
involved in the use, maintenance or planning of computer systems.


Why attend?
___________

The character of the Internet is changing rapidly. Not only has the
commercial community discovered new possibilities offered by "direct"
marketing and advertisement. Governmental and non-academic organizations

have also turned their attentions to the potential of the Internet.
Incident Handling must adapt to the changing user base of the Internet.

In addition to the opportunity for those involved in computer security to
get together and discuss all aspects of the subject, the workshop will
provide the opportunity to listen to experts in the fields of computer
security incident response and vulnerability analysis. They will share
their
valuable expertise by speaking about their experience in dealing
successfully
with the coordination of incidents traversing international boundaries,
highlighting particular problems where appropriate.
There is no other workshop dedicated to this topic in the world.


Important Dates:
________________

Abstract/Proposals Due:              January  15, 1998
Authors Notified:                    February 10, 1998
Full Materials for Proceedings Due:  April     1, 1998


Format of the workshop:
_______________________

The first day is allocated for parallel tutorial style presentations. The
remaining four days will consist of conference paper and workshop style
presentations, as well as FIRST business sessions. One evening is
allocated
for participants to hold events devoted to subjects of particular interest
("birds of a feather" sessions).

All events will be selected to further the objectives of FIRST and its
members. They may involve topics such as computer security incident
handling,
team and incident response coordination, tools, international issues, or

work in progress.

A list of example topics can be found at the end of this announcement.
Contributions should follow the following guidelines:

Tutorials:      Half or full day tutorial proposals will be considered.

Papers:         Written papers may be as long as desired, but
presentations
                must be limited to 30 minutes.

Workshop:       These informal sessions should either follow a more
                "hands-on" approach or provide for a high degree of
                audience participation. They should be tailored to address
                specific issues and should be from 60 to 90 minutes
                in duration. Panel Sessions on a particular topic are
                acceptable.


Submission information:
_______________________

Submissions should include an abstract, proposed length and single page of
notes describing the content and style of the presentation. Special
audio/visual requirements (other than one microphone and one overhead
projector) should be described. Panel session proposals should include a
list of panelists who have agreed to participate. Submissions should be
sent to the contact address given at the end of this document. The
preferred submission mechanism is via electronic mail in ASCII, HTML or
PostScript formats. Submissions via Facsimile transmission or the postal
service will, however, be accepted. Submissions must be received by the
January 15, 1998. Submissions received after this date may not be
considered for inclusion in the program.

Please use the appended form for your submissions.

Authors will be notified by the February 10, 1998 of the status of their

presentation (accepted/rejected). The final version of the material used

for the presentation (overheads, papers, slides) must be delivered to the
organizers by the April 1, 1998 for inclusion in the proceedings.

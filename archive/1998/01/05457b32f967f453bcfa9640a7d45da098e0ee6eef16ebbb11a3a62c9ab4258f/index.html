     The CCIPS is responsible for implementing the Justice Department's
     Computer Crime Initiative, a comprehensive program designed to
     address the growing global computer crime problem. Section attorneys
     are actively working with other government officials (e.g., the FBI,
     Department of Defense, NASA) the private sector (including hardware
     and software vendors and telecommunications companies), academic
     institutions, and foreign representatives to develop a global
     response to cyberattacks. These attorneys, who are responsible for
     resolving unique issues raised by emerging computer and
     telecommunications technologies, litigate cases, provide litigation
     support to other prosecutors, train federal law enforcement
     personnel, comment upon and propose legislation, and coordinate
     international efforts to combat computer crime.

     In October 1996, the National Information Infrastructure Protection
     Act of 1996 was enacted as part of Public Law 104-294. It amended
     the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which is codified at 18 U.S.C. 
     1030. Below you will find links to the amended version of 18 U.S.C.
      1030, as well as a legislative analysis, prepared by attorneys
     from the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section.

     The process of Searching and Seizing Computers raises unique issues
     for law enforcement personnel. The Federal Guidelines for searching
     and seizing computers illustrate some of the ways in which search a
     computer is different from searching a desk, a file cabinet, or an
     automobile.

     In October 1997, the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property
     Section published a Supplement to Federal Guidelines for Searching
     and Seizing Computers. This Supplement is intended to update the
     Federal Guidelines for Searching and Seizing Computers that had been
     published in July 1994. The Supplement describes relevant federal
     cases decided since July 1994 as well as a number of additional
     earlier decisions. The Supplement also describes relevant state
     cases, which had not been incorporated in the original Guidelines.

     The importance of the protection of intellectual property to the
     economic well-being and security of the United States cannot be
     overestimated. The Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section
     wrote the attached manual to assist law enforcement in the
     investigation and prosecution of violations of federal criminal
     copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws. Section I of the manual
     contains an overview of the protection of intellectual property, and
     discusses the basic scope of copyright, trademark, and trade secret
     and patent law. Section II focuses on intellectual property entitled
     to copyright protection and Section III describes the applicability
     of various federal criminal statutes to copyright infringement.
     Section IV addresses the prosecution for trafficking in counterfeit
     goods under 18 U.S.C.  2320. Section V discusses the prosecution of
     trade secret thefts and analyzes the recently enacted Economic
     Espionage Act of 1996. Finally, Section VI contains a list of
     contact persons, model indictments, search warrant affidavits, jury
     instructions, state criminal trade secret statutes, and the
     legislative history of the Copyright Felony Act and the Economic
     Espionage Act of 1996.

   B. Operation "Counter Copy" 
   
     
     
     In early May, the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of
     Investigation released the first results of a nationwide law
     enforcement effort to crack down on trademark and copyright fraud,
     which is estimated to cost American businesses millions of dollars
     each year and cheat unsuspecting consumers who purchase counterfeit
     products. As a result of the joint effort, called Operation "Counter
     Copy," 35 indictments were returned since the beginning of April for
     copyright or trademark infringement. More information about
     Operation Counter Copy, including a press release and brief
     summaries of the cases, are available via the links below.

   D. The Economic Espionage Act
   
     The Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section is also charged
     with evaluating all requests for approval of charges under the
     Economic Espionage Act and making a recommendation regarding the
     approval of such requests to the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney
     General, or Assistant Attorney General. In addition, the Section
     also prosecutes certain Economic Espionage cases directly.
     
     Four Pillars Case
     
     One well-publicized case currently being prosecuted by the Section
     involves the alleged theft of trade secrets by the Four Pillars

  IV. ENCRYPTION AND COMPUTER CRIME
  
   
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   
     The nation's policy on encryption must carefully balance important
     competing interests. The Department of Justice has a vital stake in
     the country's encryption policy because encryption may be used not
     only to protect lawful data against unauthorized intruders, it may
     also be used to conceal illegitimate materials from law enforcement.
     While we support the spread of strong encryption, we believe that
     the widespread dissemination of unbreakable encryption without any
     accommodation for law enforcement access is a serious threat to
     public safety and to the integrity of America's commercial
     infrastructure. Our goal is to encourage the use of strong
     encryption to protect privacy and commerce, but in a way that
     preserves (without extending) law enforcement's ability to protect
     public safety and national security. Accordingly, the Administration
     has promoted the manufacture and use of key recovery products, aided
     the development of a global key management infrastructure ("KMI"),
     and liberalized United States restrictions on the export of robust
     cryptographic products. We anticipate that market forces will make
     key recovery products a de facto industry standard and thus preserve
     the balance of privacy and public safety that our Constitution
     embodies.
     
    A. Letter from Attorney General Janet Reno and others to Members of
   Congress regarding law enforcement's concerns related to encryption
   
     On July 18, 1997, Attorney General Janet Reno and others sent a
     letter to Members of Congress outlining law enforcement's concerns
     about the public safety and national security threats posed by
     unbridled availability of strong encryption. It urged legislators to
     support a balanced approach that supports commercial and privacy
     interest while maintaining law enforcement's ability to investigate
     and prosecute serious crime. This letter was co-signed by:
     * Louis Freeh, Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation
     * Barry McCaffrey, Director, Office of National Drug Control Policy
     * Thomas A. Constantine, Director, Drug Enforcement Administration,
     * Lewis C. Merletti, Director, United States Secret Service

  V. INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS OF COMPUTER CRIME
  
   
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   
   
   
   With the explosive growth of the Internet worldwide, computer crimes
   increasingly are prone to have international dimensions. Some of the
   challenges faced by law enforcement on the international front
   include: harmonization of countries' criminal laws; locating and
   identifying perpetrators across borders; and securing electronic
   evidence of their crimes so that they may be brought to justice.
   Complex jurisdictional issues arise at each step. The Department of
   Justice is working with foreign governments through many channels to
   address global threats related to computer crime. A. Attorney General
   Janet Reno's speech to Senior Experts representing the G-7 on January
   21, 1997 
   
   On January 21, 1997, Attorney General Janet Reno spoke to Senior
   Experts representing the G-7 group of leading industrialized nations
   (now, with the inclusion of Russia, known as The Eight). The Attorney
   General's speech addressed the challenges presented to law enforcement
   by hightech and computer criminals, and she suggested a number ways in
   which the United States and its allies can respond to this global
   threat. Her speech is available via the link below.

   A. Computer-Telecommunications Coordinator ("CTC") Program
   
     Coordination among prosecutors in high-tech crime cases has improved
     dramatically because of the implementation, since January 1995, of
     the "Computer-Telecommunications Coordinator" ("CTC") program. Under
     the CTC program, each United States Attorney's Office, as well as a
     few other Department entities, has designated at least one Assistant
     U.S. Attorney to serve as a CTC, with a few distinct areas of
     responsibility. To reach a CTC, contact the Computer Crime and
     Intellectual Property Section, or the U.S. Attorney's office in a
     particular district. CTC responsibilities are outlined below.

     The Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section of the
     Department of Justice submitted comments in response to the request
     of the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") for comments on its workshop
     on Consumer Information Privacy and its Data Base Study. The
     Department is deeply concerned about the safety and security of
     American citizens. The Department is vigilant to take appropriate
     measures to guard their privacy while using all the resources at its
     disposal, including information resources, to investigate and
     prosecute violations of the federal criminal law. The comments are

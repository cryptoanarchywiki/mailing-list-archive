IT WAS JUST RELEASED!!
 
INTRODUCING...MILLIONS VOL. 1A

We took a total of over 92 million email addresses from many of the
touted CD's that are out there (bought them all - some were $300+)!
We added the millions we had in storage to those.   When we
combined them all, we had in excess of 100+ million addresses
in one huge file.

We then ran a super "sort/de-dupe" program against this huge list.
It cut the file down to less than 25 million!!! Can you believe that? It
seems that most people that are selling CD's are duping the public
by putting numerous files of addresses in the CD over and over. This
created many duplicate addresses. They also had many program
 "generated" email addresses like Compuserve, MCI, ANON's, etc.
This causes a tremendous amount of undeliverables, and for  those
that use Stealth programs, clogs up servers quickly with trash, etc.

We then ran a program that contained 1800+ keywords to remove
addresses with vulgarity,  profanity, sex-related names, postmaster,
 webmaster, flamer, abuse, spam, etc., etc.   Also eliminated all .edu,
.mil, .org, .gov, etc.   After that list was run against the remaining list,
it  reduced it down to near 10 million addresses!

So, you see, our list will save people hundreds of dollars buying all
others that are out there on  CD and otherwise. Using ours will be like
 using the 100+ million that we started with, but a lot less money and
alot less time!!

We also purchased Cyber-Promos ($995.00) CD.  We received it just
prior to finishing production work on the new CD.  We had our people
take a random sample of 300,000 addresses  from the touted 2.9 that
they advertised.   We used a program that allows us to take a random
sample of addresses from any list.  We were able to have the program
take every 9th address, thus giving us a 300,000 list of Cyber's email
addresses from top to bottom.  We cleaned these, and came up with about
100,000 addresses. These are also mixed in.

We also included a 6+ million "Remove/Flamer" file broke into seperate
files for ease of  extracting and adding to your own database of removes.

 "You can buy from the REST or you can buy from the BEST.   Your choice.

What others are saying:
 
"I received the CD on Friday evening.   Like a kid with a new toy, I
immediately started bulking out using the new email addresses.  Over
the course of the weekend, I emailed out over 500,000 emails and I
received less than TWENTY undeliverables!!  I am totally satisfied
with my purchase!!  Thanks Premier!!"

"This list is worth it's weight in gold!!  I sent out 100,000 emails for my
product and received over 55 orders!

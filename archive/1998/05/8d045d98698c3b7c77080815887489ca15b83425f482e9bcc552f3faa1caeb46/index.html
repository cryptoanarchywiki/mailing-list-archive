Hello Fellow Marketer,

We have everything you need to promote your online
business and target your advertising!!

The "Master Marketers Resource CD."

This CD has over 20 Million categorized, targeted and
general email addresses! Targeted email addresses are 
by far the most expensive... but for a limited time, we 
are including them on the Master Marketers Resource CD.

Do not be mistaken... this offer is not like any other
you have ever received. We have seen randomly gathered
email address CD's selling for as much as $249.00 
Just one I received today was offering 15 million AOL 
addresses for $189.95!! They were not targeted, categorized,
or nothing! Just 15 million AOL addresses of who knows what.

We also have AOL addresses on the Master Marketers
Resource CD; 4,000,000... We also have addresses of
Business Opportunity Seekers; 1,000,000... Adult Web Site 
Subscribers; 135,000 (we sell this list alone for $250.00 - 
but it is included on this Resource CD). 

Investor oriented addresses; 300,000... E-Mail addresses 
sorted by city; 200,000... General consumer lists; 290,000 
Email addresses of those interested in Health; 230,000... 
and over 150,000 Food Enthusiasts!! Make no mistake!!... 
this is by far the best collection of email addresses available 
anywhere. 

In all... there are 11 categories (over 2,500,000 of targeted 
email addresses) and over 20,000,000 addresses from the top
three internet/online providers. We have also included a 
remove/undeliverable list that's over 100 meg in size!! We 
have already cleaned the addresses on the Master Marketer 
Resource CD using this massive remove file... they are ready to
mail right now.


As A Special Bonus...

In addition to the email addresses... we have also included
on the CD over 30 CGI Scripts (one will hide where your
mail is being sent to on your order forms - must have for 
taking orders). There are forum scripts, chat scripts and
just about any other cgi script you will ever need.

We have also included over 50 java scripts! Many are
scripts for adding rotating banners to your site, adding
scrolling ticker and marque messages and scripts that password
protect a page on your web site.

We have also included demos of over 15 of the top bulk
email programs on the Internet. Stealth, Rapid Fire, NetContact
and many more! We have also included demo's of email address
harvesters like Hurricane, Grabber and Atomic Harvestor that
let you extract fresh email addresses out of forums and
right out of web pages. 

There is much more on the CD than we can go into on a short
letter like this one (there is over 10 html editors, over
200 marketing reports and more). In all... in addition to
the bulk email and html editors... there is over 20 of the
top software programs on the Internet. From programs that
keep you connected to the Internet... to programs that let
you accept checks online (this one is a registered version)! 

You will save hours (if not weeks) in download time as we have
included the top shareware and freeware programs available
anywhere. 

If you are serious about making money on the Internet... you
must have the Master Marketers Resource Cd! There is nothing
like it currently available! 

If you are ready to target your advertising... you can order
the Master Marketers Resource CD by completing the form
below. Don't miss out... we are only selling a limited number
of the Master Marketer Resource CD's. In order to preserve the
responsiveness of the addresses, this offer may be withdrawn 
at anytime.

------------------------------------------------------------
Please note: Most of the software on the CD is shareware. If
you like it... buy it. We have included the programs because
we feel most are pertinent to Internet marketing.

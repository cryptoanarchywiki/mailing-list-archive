***THIS IS NOT SPAM***
My name is Dan.  I make a habit of deleting mail I have not read, as I'm sure you do.  Please read this one though, you might find this interesting.
     I recently lost my high paying job from a major computer corporation due to their loss of a major contract.  They messed up, but that whole department of 15 people including myself are hung out to dry.  Corporate America at it's finest.  I have not had luck yet finding another job, as my skills were very specific to that company and not really worth anything to another company.
During the time I worked there, I also bought and sold Real Estate like those guys on TV (yes, you can do that and make it work for you).  The key is I made it work.  I was fairly successful until the "nightmare on Pleasant St." as my friends and I call it....
I lost money in one bad deal and I was no longer financially secure and I relied heavily on my income from my FORMER JOB.
As you've already heard, I lost that too and I started to look for other things I could do to make money until I could get back on my feet.  So I started to read all of the JUNK that was mailed to me.  Let me tell you, I can't believe some of the things out there... what a waste of time.
Until I saw this.
Hold on, I know you are (like I was) ready to stop right here.
     I implore you not to.
I, like you am NOT some non-educated fool.
I have made a lot of money for myself in Real Estate, which is not an easy business, and I am a rather competent business man.
At least finish reading this to the end.
      **BETTER STILL; PRINT THIS LETTER AND READ IT IN
         COMFORT, OVER AND OVER
                        Here is what I saw...
                *I only needed $20 dollars to try this
                *This is making money for people who at least tried
                  a little, so why not me too?
In desperation, I sent the four 5 dollar bills and got the reports.
As I always have, I MADE this work for me too.
I took much time and effort to learn about email (which is a great and FREE tool!!) and how to send lots of it. 
Now, 19 days after my first mailing of this, I have received roughly 8,450 responses (trust me, when my wife saw 8,450 5 dollar bills on the kitchen table, she no longer laughed at me for trying this).
I wrote a report of my own showing step by step how to do the same, which I will give you for free as a helping hand so we can all continue this success.  I will show you every step of cutting, pasting, and editing this letter to include your name and address, etc.
Here is my special offer to help you...As long as my address, DDW at the Colorado Springs PO Box is on the list below I will send the step-by-step instructions and 100,000 email addresses to anyone  who orders any report from me.  It took some time and expense to put this list of addresses together so all I ask is that you add another $5 for handling the addresses.  THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR E-MAILING ARE FREE.  They will come to you in a .txt format (which I will teach you how to use in the instructions I've put together) and less than 2% will be duplicates.  You will get the list of addresses with your report.  The first 160 people who order a report from me will receive a different set of addresses.  This is my gift to you to help you get started...
     I promise you, if you follow the directions in this e-mail and be prepared to eventually set aside about an hour each day to follow up (and count your money!), you will make at least as much money as I am.  You don't need to be a whiz at the computer, but you probably already are.  If you can open an envelope, remove the money and send an e-mail message, then you're on your way to the bank.  Take the time to read this so you'll understand how easy it is.  If I can do this, so can you!
     ADD THIS E-MAIL TO YOU 'FAVORITE PLACES' FOLDER
     SO THAT YOU WILL HAVE A COPY OF THIS FOR FUTURE USE.
                     GO FOR IT NOW!!
                     Dan
The following is a copy of the e-mail I read:

OVERVIEW OF THIS
EXTRAORDINARY
ELECTRONIC MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING PROGRAM
___________________________________________
_____
Basically, this is what we do:
  We send thousands of people a product for $5.00 that costs next to nothing to produce and e-mail.  As with all multi-level businesses, we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products.  Every state in the U.S. allows you to recruit new business online (via your computer). 
The products in this program are a series of four business and financial reports costing $5.00 each.  Each order you receive via "snail mail" will include:
     *$5.00 cash
     *The name and number of the report they are ordering
     *The e-mail address where you will e-mail them the report they ordered.
  To fill each order, you simply e-mail the product to the buyer.  THAT"S IT!  The $5 is yours!  This is the easiest  electronic business anywhere!
FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER AND
BE PREPARED TO REAP THE STAGGERING BENEFITS!
******INSTRUCTIONS******
This is what you MUST do:
1. Order all four reports shown on the list below (you can't sell them if you don't order them).
     *For each report, send $5 CASH, the NAME &amp; NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING,
      YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR RETURN POSTAL ADDRESS (in case of a problem) to the
      person whose name appears on the list next to the report.
     *When you place your order, make sure you order each of the four
      reports.  You will need all four reports so that you can save them
      on your computer and resell them.
     *Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the four reports
      Save them on you computer so they will be accessible for you to send
      reports to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you.
2.  IMPORTANT- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or 
     their sequence on the list in any way other than is instructed below in steps "a" through
     "d" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits.  Once you understand the way this
     works, you'll also see how it doesn't work if you change it. Remember, this method has
     been tested, and if you alter it, it WILL NOT work.
     a. Look below for the listing of available reports.
     b.  After you've ordered the four reports, replace the name and address
          under REPORT#1 with your name and address, moving the one that was
          there down to REPORT#2.
      c. Move the name and address that was under REPORT#2 down to REPORT#3.
      d. Move the name and address that was under REPORT#3 down to REPORT#4.
      e. The name and address the was under REPORT#4 is removed from the list
           and has no doubt collected their 50 grand.
Please make sure you copy everyone's name and address ACCURATELY!!!
3.  Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, and save it to your
     computer.  Make NO changes to the instruction portion of this letter.
4.  Now you're ready to start an advertising campaign on the WORLDWIDE WEB!
     Advertising on the WEB is very, very inexpensive, and there are HUNDREDS of FREE
     places to advertise.  Another avenue which you could use for advertising is e-mail
     lists.  You can buy these lists for under $20/2000 addresses or you can pay
     someone a minimal charge to take care of it for you.  BE SURE TO START YOUR AD
     CAMPAIGN IMMEDIATELY!
5.  For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered.
     That's it!  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS!  This guarantees that the 
     e-mail THEY send out, with YOUR name and address on it, will be prompt because they
     can't advertise until they receive the report!
--------------------------------------
AVAILABLE REPORTS

***Order each REPORT by NUMBER and NAME***

Notes:
-ALWAYS SEND $5 CASH FOR EACH REPORT

HERES HOW THIS AMAZING PLAN WILL MAKE YOU $MONEY$
____________________________________

  Let's say you decide to start small just to see how well it works.  Assume your goal is to get 10 people to participate on your first level. (Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will EASILY get a larger response)  Also assume that everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 downline members.  Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING results below.
1st level-your ten members with $5.................................$50
2nd level-10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100).............$500
3rd level-10 members from those 100($5 x 1,000)..........$5,000
4th level-10 members from those 1,000($5 x 10,000).....$50,000
               Total= $55,550
Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each.  Think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate!  Most people get 100's of participants!  THINK ABOUT IT!
Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you can afford $20).  You obviously already have an Internet connection and e-mail is FREE!!  REPORT #3 shows you the most productive methods for bulk e-mail and purchasing e-mail lists.  Some lists &amp; bulk e-mail vendors even work on trade!
About 50,000 new people get online every month!
*****TIPS FOR SUCCESS*****
*  Treat this as YOUR BUSINESS!  Be prompt, professional and follow the 
    directions accurately.
*  Send for the four reports immediately so you will have them when the
   orders start coming in because:
   When you receive a $5 order, you must send out the requested product/report to comply with the U.S. Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Sections1302 and 1341 or title 18, section 3005 in the U.S. Code, also code of Federal Regs. vol.16, Sections 255 and 436, which state that "a product or service must be exchanged for money received".
*  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE.
*  Be patient and persistent with this program.  If you follow the instructions 
   exactly, the results WILL undoubtedly be SUCCESSFUL!
*  ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED!
*****YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINE*****
Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:
  If you don't receive 10 to 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks, continue advertising until you do.  Then, a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for REPORT #2.  If you don't, continue advertising until you do.  Once you have received 100 or more orders for REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you and the cash will continue to roll in!
THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:
  Every time your name is moved down the list, you are placed in front of a DIFFERENT report.  You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you.  If you want to generate more income, send another batch of e-mails and start the whole process again!  There is no limit to the income you will generate from this business!
Note: If you need help with starting a business, registering a business name, how income tax is handled, etc., contact your local office of the Small Business Administration (a federal agency) for free help and answers to questions.  Also, the Internal Revenue Service offers free help via telephone and free seminars about business taxes.
*******T E S T I M O N I A L S*******

     This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY!  Especially the rule of not placing your name in a different position, it won't work and you will lose potential income.  I'm living proof that it works.  It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money, with little cost to you.  If you do choose to participate, follow the program exactly and you'll be on your way to financial security.
    Sean McLaughlin,  Jackson, MS
My name is Frank. My wife, Doris and I live in Bel-Air MD.  I am a cost accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money.  When I received the program I grumbled to Doris about receiving "junk mail".  I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved.  I "knew" it wouldn't work.  Doris totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet.  I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old "I told you so" on her when the thing didn't work... well, the laugh was on me!  Within two weeks she had received over 50 responses.  Within 45 days she had received over $147,200 in $5 bills!  I was shocked!  I was sure that I had it all figured and that it wouldn't work.  I AM a believer now.  I have joined Doris in her "hobby".  I did have seven more years until retirement, but I think of the "rat race" and it's not for me. We owe it all to MLM.
     Frank T., Bel-Air, MD
The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short amount of time.  I was approached several times before I checked this out.  I joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required.  To my astonishment, I received $36,470.00 in the first 14 weeks, with money still coming in.
     Sincerely yours, Phillip A. Brown,  Esq
     Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.  But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back.  Boy was I surprised when I found my medium sized post office box crammed full of orders!  For a while it got so overloaded that I had to start picking up my mail at the window.  I'll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before.  The nice thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where in the U.S. people live.  There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return.
     Mary Rockland, Lansing, MI
     I had received this program before.  I deleted it but later I wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try.  Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed another copy of the program...11 months passed, then it came.  I didn't delete this one!  I made more than $41,000 on the first try!
     D. Wilburn, Muncie, IN
    This is my third time to participate in this plan.  We have quit our jobs and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money.  The only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it.  For your sake, don't pass up this golden opportunity.  Good luck and happy spending!

                                   MEGA$NETS=MEGABUCK$
                                   ANYBODY CAN DO THIS.
                                   NO APPLICATION
                                   NO INVENTORY 
                                   NO MEETING
                                   NO PRODUCTION REQUIREMENT

NO BRAINER, EVEN A MONKEY COULD DO THIS!!!

JUST $$CASH$$
LOTS &amp; LOTS &amp; LOTS OF CASH !!$$!!$$!!

This is one of the most simple and yet brilliant plans ever created. Everybody
wins! BUT you must follow it exactly!! If you do the soon you will be laughing
all the way to the bank.

You are holding information in your hands on a home-based business concept
of the next century! This is a networking breakthrough of enormous potentials!
And it is here now and ready to help you earn the kind of income you deserve!
Welcome to the majors.

MEGA$NETS combines 3 of the most powerful income opportunities of our
time....computers, mail order, and network marketing. Together, they offer you a 
home-based business you can work full or part-time. MEGA$NETS is an easy to
use yet sophisticated software program to help the average person get in on the
fabulous profits being made in the computer networking age.


Most of us know the future is in computers. An estimated 150,000 new people
are getting on the internet each month! MEGA-PROFITS will be earned 
with computers whether you and I are involved or not. So why not get involved
Now?

The IBM compatible MEGA$NETS software disk cost just $20, yet it is designed to
bring you a tremendous income within a remarkable short period of time.

HERE'S HOW IT WORKS

Purchase the MEGA$NETS software disk for just $20 from the person sharing
this opportunity with you. Load it into your PC. You will be impressed with the
professional appearance of the software and how easy it is to operate! The
Menu includes access to a complete set of instructions. you also receive
seperate written and step by step instructions,so you do not even need to be
familiar with computers!

STEP 1. The computer will ask you to type in your own name &amp; address. Be 
sure this information is correct. Once you click to the next screen, your
information will be permanently locked into the program. No one can remove 
it!!!

STEP2. Next you will see the names and addresses of 5 on your screen. Now
move to the next screen and click on " Purchase Orders". Your printer will
automatically produce a seperate Purchase Order for each of those 5 vendors.
Simply mail the orders, enclose a Self Addressed Stamped Envelope and
money order OR cash for $20 with each. In return for your orders and payment,
the 5 vendors will each send you a different code number. Your total
expenditure is $120: $20 for your original program disk and 5x20 for your codes.

STEP 3. Enter these into the computer program where it tells you to do so, and
now you are able to make copies of your disk. YOU CANNOT MAKE COPIES OF
DISKS WITHOUT THES 5 CODES. The program will not let you.

STEP 4. Once you enter the 5 codes you can now duplicate the disk and sell
each duplicated disk to other people who own or have access to a compatible
PC. They will want to buy because of the profit potential they too will have!
Selling is not difficult, Most people see the opportunity just by reading this
letter.

WHAT DO BUYERS DO?

When your customer loads your duplicated disk, they will be instructed to do the
same as you. They will purchase the computer codes they need to "unlock"
their program ( just like you did ) and begin to duplicate the disk, as many times
as they wish. Before they duplicate, your name and address will have
automatically been added into the system as an additional code vendor and
one name will have been deleted. This is no different than removing a name
from your rolodex. One name is added, one is removed.

MONEY MAKER LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN!!!

This is what could happen.

If you sell a minimum of 6 disks for $20 each, you will have back your original
$120 ( Except for the cost of some blank disks). If those 6 people sell just 6 each
all of those 36 disks will list your name and address as a code vendor. 36 people
will now send you $20 each along with a Purchase Orders generated by their disk
( total potential here is another $720 ). All you do is enter the Purchase Order
information into your program and your computer will automatically print out the
codes they have purchased from you. This takes about 30 seconds. Mail the codes
to your customers right away! Remember, the sooner they get their codes, the sooner
your name will be duplicated again and again!

Now when those 36 people sell to 6 people each, your name will automatically
move to the next position on ther screen. As one of the five code vendors, 216 (36
x 6) will each be sending you $20 for your codes ( which they must have to let
them make copies they can sell ). That's $4320 to add to your first $720...which
add up to $5040 so far. And that's only the start of it! if the 216 people sell
to only 6 others each, and your name moves to the 3rd position on everybodys
screen, potentially 1,296 people will be sending you $20...which is $25,920 PLUS
the $5,040 you received earlier. The potential earning so far could total $30,960 !


THE MULTIPLIER EFFECT  ( Here is where it becomes AWESOME !)

Your next payment in the 4th position could be $20 times 7776, which is
$155,520 .. Add that to your previous $30,960, and the grand total is $186,480...
when the 5th and final position is reached, your name disappears from future duplicated
disks. By then your TOTAL INCOME COULD BE $1,119,600!! AND REMEMBER THAT'S IF EVERYONE
IN YOUR GROUP ONLY SOLD 6 DISKS.


CAN YOU SELL MORE THAN SIX DISKS?

YES! MEGA$NETS allows you to make as manys disks as you wish. The 5 codes
you buy have licensed you to duplicate as many disks as you want. The software
will even calculate the results with whatever number you choose.

NO ONE CAN CHEAT YOU!!

That's right , it's impossible to cheat MEGA$NETS software! No names and 
addresses can be erased to put in the names of "friends", and the software is
programmed to generate constantly changing codes, nothing works! You are a true computer
software vendor and provider of valuable computer information codes that only you can
provide for your customers.


The MEGA$NETS Business System disk was developed by a professional commercial computer
programmer. It looks professional and works professionally. ( Some of today's best
whiz-kids have tried to break the system and failed.) In addition, MEGA$NETS checks itself
for viruses. If it finds any modifications, it would simply refuse to run, so your system
is fully protected without damaging your files. The distribution process is a similar
safeguard. By holding a duplicate of the software within itself, MEGA$NETS makes
absolutely sure that each copy is the same as the original, but with your personalized
information.


Let's take a mintue and truly understand what this business is all about. First of all,
it is NOT an investment. You are purchasing a product: a computer software program
with a 100% MONEY BACK GUARANTEE. Next, you can buy codes that will unlock the program
so you can make duplicated disks and sell them. Soon, customers will be requesting codes
from you. You become a vendor. You have something your customers need. That's real sales!
That's real business! Isn't that what American businesses do every day of the week? 
Don't they get paid for selling someone a product, a service or just some information?


IS THIS LEGAL?

As we have seen, MEGA$NETS is like any other legal information-driven company. 
First, you sell the software program which includes valuable marketing information
your customers can use for any business. Secondly,as an information vendor, you will be
selling valuable computer codes to your customers.Thirdly, you will be developing a 
mailing list out of your customers that can help you in promoting other customers that
can help you in promoting other income opportunities you may want to offer. Huge
multi-billion dollar worldwide companies do this every hour of the day. MEGA$NETS is no
different,we just use network marketing to get the job done.Plus, there are NO MEETINGS
TO ATTEND and no corporate headquaters or hot-shot executives who can change the plan
or grab  your earnings.


In effect, you are the owner and CEO of your own computer software network marketing
company! All you have to do now is purchase your disk and you are on your way to earnings
potential that will bring you financial independence! Just be ready to handle the volume!
You are now in the computer software mail order business. Treat this like a real business
and it can earn you the income of a real business! MEGA$INCOME.

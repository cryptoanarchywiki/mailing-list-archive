&gt;Are you a potential criminal? Are you a threat to banks, airlines, a 
&gt;potential spy, or perhaps an IRS tax protester? The government would like 
&gt;to know and they are about to force banks to be their detectives. 


Isn't this called prior restraint? Isn't it specifically illegal for the
government to treat all members of the public as criminals a priori? 

This certainly sounds like one of the grossest cases of
Feds-That-Should-Die(TM) that I have ever heard. I'm sure that the founding
fathers would have been stocking up on gun powder and lead over this one.
And I'm NOT one of the many Libertarian/Money-Gun-and-Gold-Stashing types on
this list. I far and away prefer to work inside the system peacefully. But,
it does give me pause to think about it! 

When a supposedly NON-LEA agency such as the FuckingDICks begins creating
regulations of this sort it is the most blatant proof that the constitution
has died. Perhaps it is time to start draft the next version of the
Declaration of Independence... Actually, we wouldn't need to change much. It
was an excellent document then and now and perhaps it is time shake the dust
off of it! 

Here's my take on a new version, (read carefully the changes in some cases
are subtle): 


THE DECLARATION of INDEPENDENCE 

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Action of the New Continental Consensus, July 4, 1999 
The Declaration of the People of the United States of America 
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

WHEN in the Course of human Events, it becomes necessary for one People to
dissolve the Political Bands which have connected them with another, and to
assume among the Powers of the Earth, the separate and equal Station to
which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent Respect
to the Opinions of Mankind requires that they should declare the causes
which impel them to the Separation. 

WE hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal,
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that
among these are Life, Liberty, Privacy and the Pursuit of Happiness -- That
to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their
just Powers from the Consent of the Governed, that whenever any Form of
Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People
to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its
Foundation on such Principles, and organizing its Powers in such Form, as to
them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence,
indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed
for light and transient Causes; and accordingly all Experience hath shown,
that Mankind are more disposed to suffer, while Evils are sufferable, than
to right themselves by abolishing the Forms to which they are accustomed.
*But when a long Train of Abuses and Usurpation, pursuing invariably the
same Object, evinces a Design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is
their Right, it is their Duty, to throw off such Government*, and to provide
new Guards for their future Security. Such has been the patient Sufferance
of these people; and such is now the Necessity which constrains them to
alter their former Systems of Government. The History of the present Federal
Government of the United States of America is a History of repeated Injuries
and Usurpation, all having in direct Object the Establishment of an absolute
Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid
World. 

It has refused its Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the
public Good. (Agencies such as the NSA and CIA whose actions are wholly
unsupervised and unchecked.) 

It has forbidden its Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing
Importance, unless suspended in their Operation till its Assent and
modification should be obtained; and when so suspended, it has utterly
neglected to attend to them. (Bastardization of state and local voters
measures threw inappropriate judiciary interference.) 

It has refused to pass other Laws for the Accommodation of large Districts
of People, unless those People would relinquish the Right of Representation
in the Legislature, a Right inestimable to them, and formidable to Tyrants
only. (Pick any agency... none allow for direct representation in their
regulatory actions. Public comment IS NOT direct representation!) 

It has called together Legislative Bodies at Places unusual, uncomfortable,
and distant from the Depository of their public Records, for the sole
Purpose of fatiguing them into Compliance with its Measures. 

It has investigated, harassed, terrorized, and killed members of
Representative Bodies repeatedly, for opposing with its manly Firmness its
Invasions on the Rights of the People. 

It has refused for a long Time, after such Dissolution, to allow others to
act; whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of the Annihilation, have not
been returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining
in the mean time exposing them to all the Dangers of Invasion from it, and
the Convulsions within. 

It has endeavored to prevent the Population of these States; for that
Purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to
pass others to encourage their Migrations hither, and raising the Conditions
of new ownership of Lands and Properties. 

It has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing its Assent to
Laws for respecting Judiciary Powers. (You can't sue them unless they say
it's OK... And when you do who do you sue?) 

It has made Judges dependent on its Will alone, for the Tenure of their
Offices, and the Amount and Payment of their Salaries. 

*It has erected a Multitude of new Offices, and sent hither Swarms of
Officers to harass our People, and eat out their Substance.* 

It has kept among us, in Times of Peace, Standing Armies, without the
consent or oversight of our Legislatures. (NSA, CIA, IRS, ATF, etc.) 

It has affected to render the Military and National Security Forces
independent of and superior to the Civil Power. 

*It has combined with others to subject us to a Jurisdiction foreign to our
Constitution, and unacknowledged by our Laws; giving its Assent to their
Acts of pretended Legislation:*

FOR quartering large Bodies of Armed Troops among us; 

FOR protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Punishment for any Murders which
they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States: 

FOR cutting off our Trade with all Parts of the World: (ITAR, etc.) 

FOR imposing Taxes on us without our Consent: 

FOR depriving us, in many Cases, of the Benefits of Trial by Jury: (Try to
fight an "infraction" in California!) 

FOR transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended Offences: (Hi CJ!)


FOR abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighboring Province,
establishing therein an arbitrary Government, and enlarging its Boundaries,
so as to render it at once an Example and fit Instrument for introducing the
same absolute Rules into these Colonies: (Ever been to a US territory?) 

FOR taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and
altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments: (Let's hear it for the
IRS and NSA, and now FDIC!) 

FOR suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with
Power to legislate for us in all Cases whatsoever. (Who actually makes tax
regulation?!) 

It has abducted Government here, and declared us under of its Protection and
thus waging War against us. 

It has plundered our Seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our Towns, and
destroyed the Lives of our People. 

It is, at this Time, transporting large Armies of Mercenaries to complete
the Works of Death, Desolation, and Tyranny, already begun with
circumstances of Cruelty and Perfidy, scarcely paralleled in the most
barbarous Ages, and totally unworthy of a civilized Nation. 

It has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive to bear Arms and false
testimony against their Countrymen, to become the Executioners of their
Friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands. 

It has excited domestic Insurrections amongst us, and has endeavored to
bring on the Inhabitants of our Frontiers, the merciless Profiteering Drug
Peddlers, whose known Rule of Warfare, is an undistinguished Destruction, of
all Ages, Sexes and Conditions. (Don't forget Noriega and his CIA buddies.
You wouldn't get even money on the bet that they have changed their ways...)


It has subverted the very essence of the Constitution and Bill of Rights
which gave it birth by perpetrating the following acts of barbarism and
contempt for the people: 

Confiscation of Personal Properties being routinely executed without the
most minimum attempt at DUE PROCESS; 

Routine and massive warrant-less searches and seizures of the personal
communications of the people; 

Commonplace denial of competent legal defense and availability of juries of
one's peers; 

Unconstitutional restrictions of the movement of the people and their
assets; 

Unconstitutional restrictions of the peoples' right to assemble, publicly
and privately and secretly; 

IN every stage of these Oppressions we have Petitioned for Redress in the
most humble Terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by
repeated Injury and imprisonment in State Mental Institutions. A Prince,
whose Character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is
unfit to be the Ruler of a free People. 

NOR have we been wanting in Attentions of our International Brethren. They
have warned us from Time to Time of Attempts by our Legislature to extend an
unwarrantable Jurisdiction over them. They have reminded us of the
Circumstances of our Emigration and Settlement here. They have appealed to
our native Justice and Magnanimity, and they have conjured us by the Ties of
our common Kindred to disavow these Usurpations, which, would inevitably
interrupt our Connections and Correspondence. They too have been denied the
Voice of Justice and of Consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the
Necessity, which denounces our Union in the Spirit of Freedom, and hold
them, as we hold the rest of Mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace, Friends. 

WE, therefore, the People of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, in GENERAL
CONSENSUS, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the World for the
Rectitude of our Intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good
People of these States, solemnly Publish and Declare, That these United
States are, and of Right ought to be, FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES; that they
are absolved from all Allegiance to the Federal Government, and that all
political Connection between them and the Federal Government of the USA, is
and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES,
they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances,
establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which INDEPENDENT
STATES may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm
Reliance on the Protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each
other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor. 

Signed, 

The names of course will be changed to protect the innocent... 

I may not be up to the task of editing TJ, but you get the point! 

I was going to send this through an anonymizer and sign it Thomas In Payne.
But Fuck the MIBs. This is MY Opinion Freely Stated as I'm guaranteed by the
Constitution they are so hell bent on destroying. This adaptation of such a
revered document as our dear Declaration of Independence is meant to provoke
thought and perhaps one last effort by many to halt the erosion of the
effectiveness of what was perhaps the most important statement of what a
government should be that the world has ever known. It is time that we take
back our Constitution from the MIB. 

My only question is HOW?

MILLIONS of potential Customers Overnight!

THOUSANDS of companies are sending out Bulk 
Email to dramatically maximize their profits!

Why aren't YOU?

Despite what you've heard...BULK EMAIL WORKS!

If Bulk Email didn't work, THEN YOU WOULDN'T 
BE READING THIS!

===&gt; Even FORTUNE 500 companies send out 
Bulk Email to Hundreds of Thousands of 
people every single day.

===&gt; Power Promotions, an Internet Marketing 
Company, claims to be making over $500,000
every single year in Bulk Email alone!

===&gt;Many webmasters draw THOUSANDS of NEW 
visitors to their sites DAILY!

===&gt;You don't even need a web site to take 
advantage of Bulk Email!

===&gt;You can generate an endless amount of 
quality leads for ANY business opportunity 
or MLM.

===&gt;You can save $$$ doing your own mailings 
with the latest Bulk Email software!



When you receive a Bulk Email advertisement, do 
you realize that HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS of PEOPLE 
from all over the world received that same Bulk 
Email advertisement?  

Could your business benefit from such a dramatic 
increase in exposure?

Here's what a respected national newspaper said 
regarding the use of Bulk Email:

"Many business people are finding out that they
can now advertise in ways that they never could 
have afforded in the past. The cost of sending 
mass e-mail is extremely low, and the response 
rate is high and quick." - USA TODAY

Let's keep in mind that the only expense involved 
with using Bulk Email is:

1. Purchasing Bulk Email Software
2. An Internet Connection ($19.95 A Month or Less)

Email is FREE...whether you send 100 or 1 million.  
It is by far the FASTEST and LEAST EXPENSIVE way 
to generate large volumes of sales in a short 
period of time.

Comparison of Bulk Email vs Conventional Forms 
of Advertising:

=&gt; A Bulk Mailing to 250,000 People through 
the Postal Service will cost you about $125,000.

=&gt; A Web Site Banner Advertisement to 250,000  
People on the Internet will cost you about $2,500.

=&gt; A Bulk Emailing to 250,000  People on the 
Internet will cost you NOTHING. 

DO YOU HAVE A WEB SITE?If so, you probably spend 
THOUSANDS of DOLLARS and HOURS advertising your 
web site on:

* Newsgroups
* Search Engines
* On-line Classifieds
* Banner Advertisements
* Link Exchanges

And still, you only receive a few thousand hits
 per day.

A) A previous web site of ours that opened on 
June 23rd, 1997 had a total of 1600 visitors.

B) We sent out a Bulk Email Advertisement for 
our web site to 200,000 people that same day.

C) By the next morning our counter indicated 
that we had received 12,763 Hits in LESS THAN 
24 HOURS!

You can expect the SAME, if not BETTER results
when advertising YOUR web site to MILLIONS of 
people through Bulk Email, and using our 
techniques and software you will NOT risk 
losing your ISP or web host account.

DO PEOPLE ACTUALLY BUY ANYTHING FROM THE I
INTERNET?

A recent survey by Survey Net on the purchasing 
habits of internet users, indicates that 50% 
of people have purchased something from the
Internet, 40% of people have made several 
purchases from the Internet 80% of people 
like the idea of shopping on a computer, 50% 
of on-line purchases are computer/information 
related ,20% of people have purchased from 
the Internet for the reason: 

"I came across it and I liked it, so I 
bought it."

But how can they buy from you if they don't know

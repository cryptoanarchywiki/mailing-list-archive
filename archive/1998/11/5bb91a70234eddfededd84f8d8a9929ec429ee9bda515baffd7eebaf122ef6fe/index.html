THIS IS IT FOLKS!! 

This is THE LETTER you've been READING about 
in the NEWS lately.

Due to the popularity of this letter on the 
Internet, a major nightly news program recently 
devoted an entire show to the investigation of 
the program described below, to see if it really 
can make people money.  If you saw it, you know 
that their conclusion was that while most people 
did not make the $55,000, as discussed in the plan, 
EVERYONE who followed the instructions was able to 
make 100 to 160 times their money at the VERY LEAST.  
The show also investigated whether or not the 
program was legal.  Their findings proved once and 
for all that there are absolutely no laws prohibiting 
the participation in the program.   "This is one of 
the most exciting opportunities with the MOST income 
potential on the internet today!" --48 Hours.

Hi, my name is Susan.  After I saw this letter aired 
on the news program, I decided to get some of my 
skeptical questions answered.

Question #1 - Does it really work?  Until I try it, 
I can only go on the testimony of people I don't know, 
so I will only know if I try it.  I've never done 
this type of thing, but I decided it was time to try 
something.  If I keep doing what I am doing I'll keep 
getting what I've got.  Besides, people 70 years old 
have been surveyed and they have consistently said 
that the 2 regrets they have had in their lives were 
that;

	1) They wish they had spent more time with 
	their families and
	2) They wish they had taken more chances

Upon hearing this again, and hearing what the MEDIA 
said about it, I decided that at 42, I was going to 
take a small chance and see what would come of it.

Question #2 - Is it legal? - Yes, (Refer to title 18, 
Section 1302 &amp; 1342 of the U.S. Postal and Lottery 
Laws) This opportunity isn't much of a risk and could 
turn out to actually be a bit of fun. 

Bottom Line;
The risk is only $20 and time on the Internet.
The following is a copy of the letter that the media 
was referring to:

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 

This is a LEGAL, MONEYMAKING PHENOMENON.
PRINT this letter, READ the directions, THEN READ IT 
AGAIN !!!

You are about to embark on the most profitable and 
unique program you may ever see!  Many times over, 
it has demonstrated and proven its ability to 
generate large amounts of cash!  This program is 
showing fantastic appeal with a huge and ever-growing 
on-line population desirous of additional income.
           
This is a legitimate, LEGAL, moneymaking opportunity.  
It does not require you to come in personal contact 
with people, do any hard work, and best of all, you 
never have to leave the house, except to get the mail 
and go to the bank!          
      
This truly is that lucky break you've been waiting 
for!  Simply follow the easy instructions in this 
letter, and your financial dreams can come true!  
When followed correctly, this electronic, multi-
level marketing program WORKS!
               
Thousands of people have used this program to: 
	- Raise capital to start their own businesses
	- Pay off debts
	- Buy homes, cars, etc.,
	- Even retire!

This is your chance, Don't pass it up!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OVERVIEW OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY

ELECTRONIC MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING PROGRAM
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basically, this is what we do:  
We send thousands of people a product that they 
paid us $5.00 US for, that costs next to nothing 
to produce and e-mail back to them. As with all 
multi-level businesses, we build our business by 
recruiting new partners and selling our products.  
Every state in the U.S. allows you to recruit new 
multi-level business online (via your computer).

The products in this program are a series of four 
business and financial reports costing $5.00 each.  
Each order you receive is to include:

	* $5.00 cash United States Currency

	* The name and number of the report they are 
	ordering

	* The e-mail address where you will e-mail 
	them the report they ordered.
        
To fill each order, you simply e-mail the product to 
the buyer.  THAT'S IT!  The $5.00 is yours!  This is 
the EASIEST electronic multi-level marketing business 
anywhere!


FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER AND
BE PREPARED TO REAP THE STAGGERING BENEFITS!

+++++++++ I  N  S  T  R  U  C  T  I  O  N  S +++++++++
             
This is what you MUST do:

1. Order all 4 reports shown on the list below 
(you can't sell them if you don't order them).

*  For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME &amp; 
NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL 
ADDRESS, and YOUR RETURN POSTAL ADDRESS (in case of 
a problem) to the person whose name appears on the 
list next to the report.

*  When you place your order, make sure you order 
each of the four reports.  You will need all four 
reports so that you can save them on your computer 
and resell them.

*  Within a few days you are to receive, via e-mail, 
each of the four reports.  Save them on your computer 
so they will be accessible for you to send to the 
1,000's of people who will order them from you.

2. IMPORTANT-- DO NOT alter the names of the people 
who are listed next to each report, or their sequence 
on the list, in any way other than is instructed 
below in steps "a" through "d" or you will lose out 
on the majority of your profits.   Once you understand 
the way this works, you'll also see how it doesn't 
work if you change it.  Remember that this method has 
been tested, and if you alter it, it will not work.    

a.  Look below for the listing of available reports.        
        
b.  After you've ordered the four reports, replace 
the name and address under REPORT #1 with your name 
and address, moving the one that was there down to 
REPORT #2.          

c.  Move the name and address that was under REPORT 
#2 down to REPORT #3.
  
d.  Move the name and address that was under REPORT 
#3 down to REPORT#4.
               
e.  The name and address that was under REPORT #4 
is removed from the list and has NO DOUBT collected 
large sums of cash!   
Please make sure you copy everyone's name and address 
ACCURATELY!!!

3.  Take this entire letter, including the modified 
list of names, and save  it to your computer.  Make 
NO changes to the instruction portion of this letter.       
        
4.  Now you're ready to start an advertising campaign 
on the WORLDWIDE WEB!  Advertising on the WEB can be 
very, very inexpensive, and there are HUNDREDS of 
FREE places to advertise. Another avenue, which you 
could use for advertising, is e-mail lists. You can 
buy these lists for under $20/2,000 addresses or you 
can pay someone to take care of it for you.  BE SURE 
TO START YOUR AD CAMPAIGN IMMEDIATELY!
        
5.  For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is 
e-mail them the report they ordered.  THAT'S IT!  
ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS! This 
will help guarantee that the e-mail THEY send out, 
with YOUR name and address on it, will be prompt 
because they can't advertise until they receive the 
report!  To grow fast be prompt and courteous.  

--------------------------------------
AVAILABLE REPORTS     
*Order Each REPORT by NUMBER and NAME*
   
Notes:        
-  ALWAYS SEND $5 CASH FOR EACH REPORT         
-  ALWAYS SEND YOUR ORDER VIA THE QUICKEST DELIVERY        
-  Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it 
   in at least two sheets of paper          
-  On one of those sheets of paper, include: (a) the 
number &amp; name of the report you are ordering, (b) 
your e-mail address, and (c) your postal address.

  ----------------------------------------------------
  HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PLAN WILL MAKE YOU $MONEY$
  ----------------------------------------------------
  
Let's say you decide to start small just to see how 
well it works.  Assume your goal is to get 10 people 
to participate on your first level.  (Placing a lot 
of FREE ads on the internet will EASILY get a larger 
response.)  Also assume that everyone else in YOUR 
ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 downline members.  Follow 
this example to achieve the STAGGERING results below.        
        
1st level--your 10 members with $5.............$50        

2nd level--10 members from those 10 
($5 x 100).....................................$500        

3rd level--10 members from those 100 
($5 x 1,000)...................................$5,000        

4th level--10 members from those 1,000 
($5 x 10,000)..................................$50,000        

THIS TOTALS ----------------------------------&gt;$55,550

Remember friends, this assumes that the people who 
participate only recruit 10 people each.  Think for 
a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to 
participate!  Lots of people get 100s of participants!  
THINK ABOUT IT!      

Your cost to participate in this is practically 
nothing (surely you can afford $20).  You obviously 
already have an internet connection and e-mail is 
FREE!!!  REPORT#3 shows you the most productive 
methods for bulk e-mailing and purchasing e-mail 
lists.  Some list &amp; bulk e-mail vendors even work 
on trade! 
 
About 50,000 new people get online every month

****TIPS FOR SUCCESS**** 
    
 *  TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS!  Be prompt, 
    professional, and follow the directions accurately.
 *  Send for the four reports IMMEDIATELY so you will 
    have them when the orders start coming in because:      
    When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the 
    requested product/report to comply with the U.S. 
    Postal &amp; Lottery Laws, Title 18,Sections 1302 and 
    1341 or Title 18, Section 3005 in the U.S. Code 
    also Code of Federal Regs. vol. 16, Sections 255 
    and 436, which state that "a product or service 
    must be exchanged for money received." 

 *ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU 
  RECEIVE.

 *  Be patient and persistent with this program. If 
    you follow the instructions exactly, the results 
    WILL undoubtedly be SUCCESSFUL!        

 *  ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU 
    WILL SUCCEED!

    ************YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINE************
  
Follow these guidelines to help assure your success:

If you don't receive 10 to 20 orders for REPORT #1 
within two weeks, continue advertising until you do.  
Then, a couple of weeks later you should receive at 
least 50 orders for REPORT #2.  If you don't, 
continue advertising until you do.  Once you have 
received 50 or more orders for REPORT #2, YOU CAN 
RELAX, because the system is already working for you, 
and the cash can continue to roll in!

THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:

Every time your name is moved down on the list, you 
are placed in front of a DIFFERENT report.  You can 
KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report 
people are ordering from you.  If you want to 
generate more income, send another batch of e-mails 
and start the whole process again!  There is no limit 
to the income you will generate from this business!        
        
NOTE:  If you need help with starting a business, 
registering a business name,  how income tax is 
handled, etc., contact your local office of the 
Small Business Administration (a Federal agency) for 
free help and answers to questions.  Also, the 
Internal Revenue Service offers free help via 
telephone and free seminars about business taxes.   
If you have any question of the legality of this 
letter contact the Office of Associate Director for 
Marketing Practices Federal Trade Commission Bureau 
of Consumer Protection in Washington DC.
     
**T  E  S  T  I  M  O  N  I  A  L  S**

This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY!
Especially the rule of not trying to place your name 
in a different position, it won't work and you'll lose 
a lot of potential income.  I'm living proof that it 
works.  It really is a great opportunity to make 
relatively easy money, with little cost to you.  If you 
do choose to participate, follow the program exactly, 
and you'll be on your way to financial security.
Sean McLaughlin, Jackson, MS      

The main reason for this letter is to convince you 
that this system is honest, lawful, extremely 
profitable, and is a way to get a large amount of 
money in a short time.  I was approached several 
times before I checked this out.  I joined just to 
see what one could expect in return for the minimal 
effort and money required.  To my astonishment, I 
received $36,470.00 in the first 19 weeks, with money 
still coming in.
Phillip A. Brown, Esq.              

I had received this program before. I deleted it, but 
later I wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try. 
Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another 
copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed another 
program...11 months passed then it came...I didn't 
delete this one!...I made more than $41,000 on the 
first try!!
D. Wilburn, Muncie, IN        

This is my third time to participate in this plan. 
We have quit our jobs, and will soon buy a home on 
the beach and live off the interest on our money.  
The only way on earth that this plan will work for 
you is if you do it. For your sake, and for your 
family's sake don't pass up this golden opportunity.  
Good luck and happy spending!
Charles Fairchild, Spokane, WA  

I am nearing the $90,000 mark from this program.  I 
have used several forms of advertisement.  I used 
regular mail and bulk e-mail.  The regular mail that 
I used was very expensive for two reasons. I purchased 
a very select list of names and the postage. The third 
time I sent e-mails out, I did so in the quantity of 
1 million. So, after 3 times participating in this 
program I am almost at the $90,000 mark. That isn't 
too bad. I hope the same success for you.
Raymond McCormick, New Cannan, Ct.

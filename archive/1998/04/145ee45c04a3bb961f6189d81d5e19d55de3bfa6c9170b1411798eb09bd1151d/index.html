&gt;The following is from an email which I received from a Christian group in
&gt;Israel this morning. I think it makes for interesting reading ... 
&gt;
&gt;IMPORTANT WARNING ABOUT PRINCE CHARLES
&gt;
&gt;The following is a list of overwhelming evidence which supports the theory
&gt;that Prince Charles is the biblical antichrist. Although at first glance,
&gt;this claim may seem ridiculous, the facts speak for themselves. You owe it
&gt;to yourself and your family to read this entire document before coming to a
&gt;decision. What else can I say - You've been warned !!!!!!!
&gt;
&gt;#1 - HIS NAME
&gt; Revelations 13:18 "Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count
&gt;the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is
&gt;Six hundred threescore and six". According to onomastics (the study of
&gt;names) "charles" literally means "man", in fact the words "charles" and
&gt;"man" are interchangable. So Revelations 13:18 could be interpreted as
&gt;saying "Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of
&gt;the beast: for it is the number of a CHARLES; and his number is Six hundred
&gt;threescore and six." The antichrist is also described in Daniel 9:26 as
&gt;'the prince that shall come'. If Charles is the antichrist then the term
&gt;'prince' can be taken literally.
&gt;
&gt;#2 - HIS NUMBER
&gt;According to hebrew gematria his name adds up to 666 in both English and
&gt;Hebrew (ie., "Charles Prince of Wales" or "nasich charles me wales" - the
&gt;values 1-9 are assigned to the first 9 letters of the alphabet, 10-90 for
&gt;the next 9 letters, and 100-400 for the last four letters, (they only have
&gt;22 characters in the alphabet.) Using this system of math, and applying it
&gt;to the first 22 characters of the English alphabet, (the last 4 letters
&gt;equate to zero), we can calculate names in English just as you can
&gt;calculate names in Hebrew. 
&gt;
&gt;#3a - HIS LINEAGE
&gt;Riddle of the Seven Kings, (the 3rd riddle): In the Book of Revelation,
&gt;Chapter 17, Verses 10-11, it says, "There are seven kings. Five were, one
&gt;is and one is to be. The Beast is the eighth and of the seven." There were
&gt;seven emperors of the Holy Roman Empire named Charles, (check the World
&gt;Book Encyclopedia). Prince Charles' lineage chart shows that he is
&gt;descended, through his father, from the fifth emperor of the Holy Roman
&gt;Empire named Charles, of the House of Hapsburg. Prince Charles is the
&gt;eighth and, (by his lineage), he is also of the seven (SEE HIS LINEAGE
&gt;CHART - http://www.dccsa.com/greatjoy/anti.html).
&gt;
&gt;#3b - HIS LINEAGE
&gt;Since the antichrist will attempt to impersonate the messiah, he will have
&gt;to claim to be a descendant of King David of the house of Judah. It would
&gt;be virtually impossible for any jew alive today to prove that they were
&gt;descended from King David. However, the same cannot be said for Prince
&gt;Charles. In "The Illustrious Lineage of the Royal House Of Britain" (First
&gt;Published in 1902 by The Covenant Publishing Co., Ltd., London, England),
&gt;the authors easily trace his lineage back to David and beyond. The College
&gt;of Heralds (London) has also traced Prince Charles to be the 145th direct
&gt;descendant of King David. This claim was also made in May of last year in a
&gt;documentary on Israeli television. Charles also claims descent from Islam's
&gt;false prophet Mohammed. (SEE HIS LINEAGE CHART -
&gt;http://www.dccsa.com/greatjoy/chart.html).
&gt;
&gt;#4 - HIS COAT OF ARMS / CREST - THE DOG, LION, &amp; UNICORN
&gt;Prince Charles' coat of arms and crest was designed for him by the British
&gt;College of Heraldry, using a system of guidelines over 500 years old. It
&gt;contains ALL the Biblical symbols of the Antichrist. It has a dog supported
&gt;by a roaring lion and a unicorn, (called a wild beast with a straight horn,
&gt;a wild oxen, or 'little horn'). Psalms 22:19-21 describes these animals,
&gt;with a prayer for deliverance...  "Ps 22:19 But be not thou far from me, O
&gt;LORD: O my strength, haste thee to help me.  20 Deliver my soul from the
&gt;sword; my darling from the power of the dog.  21 Save me from the lion's
&gt;mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns. " (SEE HIS
&gt;COAT OF ARMS - http://www.dccsa.com/greatjoy/crest.html).
&gt;
&gt;#4b - HIS COAT OF ARMS / CREST - THE BEAST
&gt;Revelations 13:2 And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his
&gt;feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and
&gt;the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority. The
&gt;composite beast of Revelation 13:2, with the head of a lion, body of a
&gt;leopard and feet of a bear is symbolic for other people--but not for Prince
&gt;Charles. It is on his Coat of Arms. It represents the emperors of the Holy
&gt;Roman Empire. These are the animal symbols for France, the leopard;
&gt;Germany, the Bear; and England, the lion. These nations represented the
&gt;western arm of the Holy Roman Empire. His Coat of Arms contains ten
&gt;heraldic beasts, which is a first for the British Monarchy. All previous
&gt;British Monarchs had either three or six, but none have ever had ten.
&gt;
&gt;#4c - HIS COAT OF ARMS / CREST - THE RED DRAGON
&gt;Revelations 13:2 also says, "And the dragon gave him his power and his
&gt;throne and great authority." The dragon is "symbolic" to others, but not to
&gt;Prince Charles. He has a red dragon on his coat of arms. It comes from the
&gt;flag of Wales, and it is in this title, Prince of Wales, that Charles is
&gt;heir-apparent to the throne of Great Britain. At his coronation
&gt;(investiture as Prince of Wales) in 1969, he sat on a chair with a large
&gt;red dragon emblazoned on it. During the ceremony, his mother Queen
&gt;Elizabeth II said, "This dragon gives you your power, your throne and your
&gt;authority." His response to her was, "I am now your Leige-man, and worthy
&gt;of your earthly worship." Leige is an old English word meaning "Lord". "I
&gt;am now your Lord-man, and worthy of your earthly worship." Another
&gt;reference to the red dragon is in Revelations 12:3 And there appeared
&gt;another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads
&gt;and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. Prince Charles is the ONLY
&gt;person in the world to whom "And the dragon gave him his power and his
&gt;throne and great authority" can literally be applied to!
&gt;
&gt;#4d - HIS COAT OF ARMS / CREST - THE ORDER OF THE GARTER
&gt;Another symbol on Prince Charles' Coat of Arms is that of The Order of the
&gt;Garter. The Order of the Garter is the parent organization over Free
&gt;Masonry, world-wide. When a man becomes a 33rd Degree Mason, he swears
&gt;allegiance to that organization, and thereby to Prince Charles.  According
&gt;to "The 'Morals and Dogma' of the Ancient and Accepted Rite of Freemasonry"
&gt;written by Albert Pike (Grand Commander, Sovereign Pontiff of Universal
&gt;Freemasonry, July 14, 1889) Lucifer is the GOD of Freemasonry (see page 321
&gt;of the 1942 edition). On page 819 you will find just one example of why
&gt;there are many people in Freemasonry who believe that it is natural to be a
&gt;Christian and a Mason. Masonry intentionally misleads the low degree
&gt;initiates and hides the truth that the god of Freemasonry is Lucifer,
&gt;except to those in the 30th and higher degrees. "The Blue Degrees are but
&gt;the outer court or portico of the Temple. Part of the symbols are displayed
&gt;there to the Initiate, but he is intentionally misled by false
&gt;interpretations. It is not intended that he shall understand them; but it
&gt;is intended that he shall imagine he understands them." Further proof of
&gt;Lucifer worshipping amongst Freemason can be seen in how they measure the
&gt;year. For instance the year 1998 (up until september) is according to
&gt;freemasonry the year 5997 A.L. (that is 5997 anno lucifer).
&gt;
&gt;#4e - HIS COAT OF ARMS / CREST - OTHER SIGNS
&gt;The chain on the unicorn is loose, all previous coats of arms show it
&gt;attached (see II Thessalonians 2:6). Inner motto reads "Evil on him who
&gt;thinks evil". Lower motto reads "I serve", "Service is something that you
&gt;give to people, particularly if they want you to - but sometimes if they
&gt;don't"
&gt;
&gt;#5 - THE MARK OF THE BEAST
&gt;Revelation 13:16 "And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor,
&gt;free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their
&gt;foreheads." On March 6th, 1996 on CNN, Prince Charles showed the world that
&gt;he and his two sons William and Harry, had been the first people to be
&gt;voluntarily implanted with a microchip (traceable biochip) in their right
&gt;hands,  alledgedly for security purposes. 
&gt;
&gt;#6a - ONE WORLD RELIGION - THE RELIGION OF THE ANTICHRIST
&gt;On June 26th 1994, Charles announced that when he becomes king he will
&gt;relinquish the monarch's role as head of the Church of England. He said he
&gt;would rather be seen as "defender of faith," rather than "defender of the
&gt;faith." "I happen to believe that the Catholic subjects of the sovereign
&gt;are as important [as the Protestants], not to mention the Islamic, Hindu
&gt;and Zoroastrian," he told the Independent Television network.  There are
&gt;currently at least two biographies available on Charles that describe his
&gt;desire to unite all the world's religions 'in order for peace' (see Daniel
&gt;11:37).
&gt;
&gt;#6b - ONE WORLD RELIGION - CHARLES CONVERTS TO ISLAM?
&gt;Various reports have appeared in London and Arab newspapers over the last
&gt;few years, claiming that Charles has converted to Islam. This supposedly
&gt;took place when he met with the mufti of Cyprus Shaykh Nazim Adil (in
&gt;1993). Now while there's no actual evidence to prove that he has converted
&gt;to Islam, there is no evidence to prove that he hasn't. In fact his lecture
&gt;delivered in February 1994 at Oxford extoling the virtues of Islam, his
&gt;frequent visits to Islamic holy places, his dedication of a South London
&gt;mosque, outfitted in traditional Sunnah attire; and his 1993 trip to see
&gt;the Quran of Sayiddina `Uthman (in Tashkent, Uzbekistan) with Shaykh Hisham
&gt;Kabbani, only lend credence to the claim. Of course, this is just the sort
&gt;of tactic to expect from the antichrist. That is to say, if he were to
&gt;openly come out and say that he had converted to Islam, this would make
&gt;many Jews wary of him. Whereas, if he were to spread rumours that he was a
&gt;muslim and not publicly deny them, then he could get muslims onside whilst
&gt;not alienating Jews.
&gt;
&gt;#7 - JACOB'S PILLAR (THE STONE OF DESTINY)
&gt;On June 2nd 1953, with the knights of the garter carrying and holding the
&gt;canopy over her head, Elizabeth II was anoited and crowned as "Queen of thy
&gt;people Israel". Both Prince Charles and his mother believe that the throne
&gt;upon which the queen was crowned, the famous coronation chair at
&gt;Westminster Abbey in London, is the rightful throne of King David. One of
&gt;the reasons for this is because up until recently it contained a 336 pound
&gt;stone known as Jacob's Pillar (also referred to as Jacob's head-rest, the
&gt;stone of Scone, or the stone of destiny). For more information on the
&gt;signifigance of this stone see Genesis 28:18. Legend has it that Jeremiah
&gt;transported it to Ireland where it was used as a coronation stone. It was
&gt;then brought to Scotland where it was used for a millenium to crown Scotish
&gt;Kings. In 1296, Edward I stole the stone and took it to England, where it
&gt;was placed in Westminster Abbey, and used since 1308 for English
&gt;coronations. On St Andrews Day, 30th November 1996, on Queen Elizabeth's
&gt;orders, the stone was taken back to Scotland and installed in Edinburgh
&gt;Castle. I (as do many people) believe that this stone will be used to crown
&gt;the antichrist (posing as the messiah). (See also Ezekiel 21:27, Genesis
&gt;49:10, Daniel 9:24, and Ezekiel 37:22).
&gt;
&gt;#8 - THE ASSASSINATION OF PRINCESS DIANA
&gt;The Pont de l'Alma tunnel, the site where Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed
&gt;were assassinated has great occultic signifigance. The site is ancient,
&gt;dating back to the time of the Merovingian kings (ca. 500 - 751 A.D.), and
&gt;before. In pre-Christian times, the Pont de l'Alma was an underground
&gt;chamber and used as a pagan sacrificial site. The Founder of the
&gt;Merovingian dynasty was Merovaeus, said to be descended from the union of a
&gt;sea creature and a French queen. Merovaeus followed the pagan cult of
&gt;Diana. In Middle English, "soul" (Alma) has as etymology "descended from
&gt;the sea." "Pont," has as a Latin root "pontifex," meaning a Roman high
&gt;priest. (See also pons, pontis -- bridge; passage.) " One translation of
&gt;Pont de l'Alma would be "bridge of the soul." If Charles is the antichrist,
&gt;then I wonder what Diana would have had to say (had she lived) when he
&gt;declares himself the messiah, and how many people would've taken her
&gt;opinion into consideration before believing his claims!
&gt;
&gt;#9 - THE PRIORY OF SION &amp; THE MEROVINGIANS
&gt;Many blasphemous European royalty including Prince Charles and Queen
&gt;Elizabeth II claim to be of the Blood line of Jesus Christ and Mary
&gt;Magdalene. According to the lie, Jesus didn't die on the cross and rise
&gt;from the dead. Instead they claim he married Mary Magdalene and fathered a
&gt;number of children. This bloodline is referred to as the "Holy Grail", with
&gt;those possessing it believing themselves the rightful heirs to the throne
&gt;of Jerusalem. They believe that a new king of "the holy seed of David" will
&gt;preside over the "Masonic kingdom" of Israel and the world. Prince Charles'
&gt;link to the non-existant bloodline of Christ is through the Merovingian
&gt;Kings of France. He is alledgedly descended from the Merovingian
&gt;Hildegarde. Princess Diana's Bloodline can also be traced back to the
&gt;Merovingians. This is why Prince Philip selected her.
&gt;
&gt;If the above examples aren't enough to convince you then here are a few
&gt;more facts to take into consideration ...
&gt;
&gt;- Prince Charles is heir to the highest ranking office on earth to be
&gt;attained solely by birthright.
&gt;
&gt;- Israel became a state in 1948. Prince Charles was born in 1948.
&gt;
&gt;- In 1992 (just before the full unification in 1993) Charles applied to the
&gt;EU (European Union) to be made King of Europe. He was turned down by the
&gt;European parliment, but has since developed enormous support among European
&gt;royalty and the moneyed elite.
&gt;
&gt;- Prince Charles' own business forum website is at http://www.oneworld.org.
&gt;His World Business Forum comprises 200 of the world's top corporate leaders
&gt;and consolidates 26% of the world's wealth. Charles is literally able to
&gt;steer the environmental ethics &amp; business agendas of the world's most
&gt;powerful multinational companies.
&gt;
&gt;- The holdings of the House of Windsor constitute enormous wealth including
&gt;the Archer-Daniels-Midland company (they are stockholders with controlling
&gt;interest) which controls 75% of the world's grain. In times of famine, the
&gt;royal family will literally be able to control who eats and who starves.
&gt;
&gt;- Prince Charles considers himself to be psychic and believes in guidance
&gt;from the spirit realm. The Queen (also involved in spiritism) and Prince
&gt;Philip both believe that Charles, "is the Chosen One - placed  in line for
&gt;the throne through a divine, preordained plan." 
&gt;
&gt;- In 1977, Charles went to Ghana, Africa where he claimed to have had a
&gt;mystical experience. The news reports quoted him as saying that it was
&gt;like, "St. Paul's conversion on the road to Damascus."
&gt;
&gt;- One of Prince Charles' key men is the Canadian Maurice Strong. Strong is
&gt;a top Illuminati operative and head of many world organizations. He has
&gt;been under secretary of the U.N. for many years. He headed up the Rio
&gt;Summit, World Conservation Bank, World Economic Forum, U.N. Commission on
&gt;Global governance. He is also chairman of the Earth Council and the World
&gt;Resources Institute and has been a top player in Planetary Citizens, the
&gt;World Future Society, Aspen Institute, Business Council for Sustainable
&gt;Development, Lindisfarne Association, World Federation of United Nations
&gt;Associations, the Club of Rome, and about 30 other major organizations - to
&gt;name but a few of his powerful  connections.
&gt;
&gt;- To give you some idea of Charles' influence: He is behind three of the
&gt;most important documents of this decade, the U.N.'s Global Security
&gt;Programme (he personally initiated the United Nations Global Security
&gt;Program), the 7 Year Oslo Accord, and the Rio Summit's `Agenda 21'. Up
&gt;until recently he headed the United World Colleges, he is credited with
&gt;instigating alternative medicine, and with the success of the 1992 Earth
&gt;Summit in Rio De Janeiro.
&gt;
&gt;- According to an article which appeared in the London Times on July 15th,
&gt;1998, titled "The Charles And Tony Show" many Britons are becoming
&gt;concerned about Prince Charles' meddling in the daily political affairs of
&gt;the Tony Blair government. To quote the article "Charles' involvement is
&gt;causing considerable controversy in certain British quarters, who claim
&gt;that he is over-stepping the bounds, of publicly allowable behavior, by a
&gt;member of the Royal Family, in daily political events.
&gt;
&gt;- In the early 1990's representatives of Israel and the Palestinians were
&gt;invited to a secret meeting in London, during which it was decided to try
&gt;secret negotiations in Oslo, Norway. The Israelis were represented by
&gt;Yitzchak Rabin, and the Palestinians were represented by King Hussein of
&gt;Jordan (both 33rd degree masons). The third party at that meeting was Lord
&gt;Victor Mischcon (also a 33rd degree mason), and personal attorney for
&gt;Prince Charles. 
&gt;
&gt;- Prince Charles attended the funeral of Yitzchak Rabin. Within two hours
&gt;after the funeral, according to the Jerusalem Post, Prince Charles was in
&gt;Prime Minister Shimon Peres' office "insisting" that he attend a meeting at
&gt;the Orient House, (in the Palestinian sector of Jerusalem), to begin
&gt;negotiations to give back the Golan Heights to Syria. (IMPORTANT: SEE
&gt;http://www.dccsa.com/greatjoy/coincidences.html).
&gt;
&gt;- An article appeared in the Sunday Mirror on August 31 1997 (only hours
&gt;before Princess Diana was assassinated). It was titled "Queen To Strip
&gt;Harrods of Its Royal Quest" (by Andrew Golden). To quote the article
&gt;"Prince Philip, in particular, has made no secret as to how he feels about
&gt;his daughter-in-law's latest man, referring to Dodi as an `oily
&gt;bed-hopper." "He's been banging on about his contempt for Dodi and how he
&gt;is undesirable as a future stepfather to William and Harry. Diana has been
&gt;told in no uncertain terms about the consequences should she continue the
&gt;relationship with the Fayed boy. Options must include possible exile,
&gt;although that would be very difficult as when all is said and done, she is
&gt;the mother of the future King of England."
&gt;
&gt;- According to Prince Charles "I am sure that many people consider that the
&gt;United Kingdom is in an ideal geographical and historical position to act
&gt;as an interpreter and mediator between the United States and Europe."
&gt;
&gt;- In 1991, as his son William was undergoing emergency surgery for a
&gt;near-fatal head wound, "Prince charles left the hospital to go to Covent
&gt;Garden Opera House, where he was to host a party of European Community
&gt;officials.
&gt;
&gt;- To truly understand Charles, it is important to understand his father,
&gt;Prince Philip. Philip is a eugenicist who wants reduce the population of
&gt;this planet from a current level of about 5.3 billions persons, to much
&gt;less than 1 billion within the next two generations. To quote Prince Philip
&gt;- "In the event that I am reincarnated, I would like to return as a deadly
&gt;virus, in order to contribute something to solve overpopulation." And
&gt;Philip is off to a flying start. He is the head of the World Wildlife Fund
&gt;(Worldwide Fund for Nature) an organisation whose policies are not only
&gt;responsible for the extinction of many species of animals but also for the
&gt;deaths of literally millions of sub-saharan Africans. Although Philip
&gt;pretends to be a champion on endangered species, in January 1961, a few
&gt;months before he would launch of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Prince
&gt;Philip went on a royal tour of India where he not only shot and killed an
&gt;Indian tiger (check news achives for the photo) but also an exceedingly
&gt;rare Indian rhinoceros. Only 250 were then left in the world, but that
&gt;didn't stop Philip from shooting it. The dead rhino's terrified calf
&gt;managed to escape but probably died later as it was so young. In a May
&gt;18th, 1990 address to the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., Prince
&gt;Philip asserted: ``it is now apparent that the ecological pragmatism of the
&gt;so-called pagan religions, such as that of the American Indians, the
&gt;Polynesians, and the Australian Aborigines, was a great deal more realistic
&gt;in terms of conservation ethics than the more intellectual monotheistic
&gt;philosophies of the revealed religions.'' (Like father, like son!)
&gt;
&gt;- Prince Charles may seem like a wimp, however he is quite athletic, an
&gt;expert horseman, a qualified jet fighter pilot in the Royal Air Force, a
&gt;qualified helicopter pilot in the Royal Navy, and a senior military officer
&gt;in all three branches of armed services.
&gt;
&gt;- Some of the rumours to have dogged Charles over the years include
&gt;homosexuality, adultery, occultic practices and spiritualist worship.
&gt;
&gt;- No one else on Earth has the religious, political, financial, historic,
&gt;and other ties that Charles has!
&gt;
&gt;- Prince Charle's media exposure has exceeded that of any other man in
&gt;history!
&gt;
&gt;- Only the true antichrist can fulfill every biblical prophecy (WITHOUT
&gt;EXCEPTION) related to the antichrist. Daniel 9:26-27 clearly states that
&gt;the antichrist must be a prominent ruler, (presumably a prince of Roman
&gt;lineage)!
&gt;
&gt;- If Charles is the antichrist then he should receive a fatal head wound,
&gt;sometime in the near future. A fatal head wound from which he will
&gt;miraculously recover!
&gt;
&gt;There are many more so called coincidences, but don't take my word for it,
&gt;read your bible, goto your library, lookup old newspapers, and keep an eye
&gt;on the so-called Royal family. Still not convinced, then read
&gt;2Thessalonians 2:9-2:12 ...
&gt;
&gt;Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and
&gt;signs and lying wonders, And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in
&gt;them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that
&gt;they might be saved. And for this cause God shall send them strong
&gt;delusion, that they should believe a lie: That they all might be damned who
&gt;believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
&gt;
&gt;You've been warned !!!!!!!

The crypto problem was solved in 1918.  Vernam and Maugborne [sp?]
did the work.

Gilbert Vernam in 1918. Vernam used two tapes of random characters to
generate the additional characters. With the same tapes at each end set
to the same start position this system was unbreakable. The Germans
decided that the distribution of these key tapes presented too great an
operational problem and the Lorenz machine uses a complicated
mechanical gearing and cam system to generate a pseudo random sequence
with very long period and 10^19 complexity. They thought this
was good enough to ensure unbreakability, it wasn't!

Fushimi's implementation of Lewis and my GFSR algorithm has 
period of 2^521 - 1.  And LOTS of possible starting seeds.

John Young kindly posted my article on putting non-singular binary
matrices in one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers.

Although the period of a shift register can be 2^521 - 1, 521 bits
determines THE EXACT SEQUENCE of the remaining 2^521 - 522 bits.

Pseudorandom numbers generators have an easier job than bits
used for cryptography.  

Pseudorandom number generators merely have to deceive statistical 
tests.

Orlin   Recall the GIANT radio transmitter in the south of Russia,
perhaps Baku.  

I heard on PBS TV that it was transmitting a shift register sequence. 
The 
Russians were apparently trying to communicate with underwater
submarines.

NSA crypto algorithms mostly rely on shift register sequences - both
linear and NON-LINEAR.  The R register in my SAND report posted at
jya.com implements a non-linear SECRET/NSI feedback algorithm.

Perhaps someone may have to put NSA's SECRET/NSI R register non-linear 
feedback function out on the web some time.  

So that every one can have a good laugh, of course.  Like for the
SECRET/NSI
number 31 algorithm step.

John Young   Judge Svet made a ruling.  I sent a copy
to you by snail mail.

Later,

Title: Colossus Rebuild






The Colossus Rebuild Project
by Anthony E Sale, FBCS

A bit of History

Colossus was designed and built at the Post Office Research
Laboratories at Dollis Hill in North London  in 1943 by a team led by Dr
Tommy Flowers to help Bletchley Park in decoding the intercepted German
telegraphic cipher traffic enciphered using the Lorenz SZ42 cipher
machine.


Lorenz SZ42 cipher machine at Bletchley Park



This cipher machine enciphered electrical teleprinter signals which
used the international 5 bit Baudot teleprinter code. It enciphered the
input plain text by adding to it successively two characters before
transmission. Because this addition was bit by bit modulo 2, at the
receiving end with the Lorenz machine set to the same start position,
the same two characters were added again to the received characters
revealing the original plain text.
This scheme had been developed in
America by Gilbert Vernam in 1918. Vernam used two tapes of random
characters to generate the additional characters. With the same tapes at
each end set to the same start position this system was unbreakable. The
Germans decided that the distribution of these key tapes presented too
great an operational problem and the Lorenz machine uses a complicated
mechanical gearing and cam system to generate a pseudo random sequence
with very long period and 10^19 complexity. They thought this was good
enough to ensure unbreakability, it wasn't!


A bibliography of works discussing the Lorenz
cipher has been compiled by
Frode Weierud is availabe here by
permission.  As is a book chapter describing the
Swedish effort to crack Lorenz.


The German high command thought that the Lorenz machine was
completely unbreakable and used it for their most secret messages,
literally from Hitler to his generals and between generals. The
interception and deciphering of these messages gave Generals Eisenhower
and Montgomery vital information prior to and after D Day in 1944.


Colossus was the world's first large electronic valve programmable
logic calculator, not just one but ten of them were built and
operational in Bletchley Park the home of Allied WW II codebreaking.

The question of what is the worlds first computer is less a question
of history than a question of definition.
The Mark 1 at
Manchester (1948) is a strong contender.


A view of Colossus



Colossus found the wheel settings used by the German Lorenz machine
operator for a particular message. When these had been found, which took
about two hours, they were plugged up on the Tunny machine. It was this
machine which actually deciphered the message.



This is the Tunny room in Bletchley Park in 1945.

Colossus, hardware details


Input:
    cipher text
	punched onto 5 hole paper tape read at 5,000 characters per second by
	optical reader
Output:
    Buffered onto relays: Typewriter printing onto paper roll
Processor:
    Memory 5 characters of 5 bits held in a shift register.
	Clock speed 5kc/s derived from input tape sprocket
	holes. Internally generated bit streams totalling  501 bits in rings of
	lengths equal to the number of mechanical lugs on each of the 12 Lorenz
	wheels. A large number of pluggable logic gates. 20 decade counters
	arranged as 5 by 4 decades. 2,500 valves.
Power supplies
    +200v to -150v at up to 10A.
Power consumption
    4.5KWatt
Size:
    Two banks of racks 7ft 6inches high by 16ft wide spaced 6 ft apart.
	Bedstead, 7ft 6inches high 4ft wide by 10ft long


Colossus, operating cycles

The basic machine cycle: read
a character from tape,  get bits from bit stream generators, perform up
to 100 logic operations, clock result into decade counters.


The cycle determined by the input tape: The intercepted
enciphered text tape is joined into a continuous loop with
about 150 blank characters in the join. Specially punched
start and stop holes indicate the beginning and end of the
cipher text.


On receipt of start hole pulse: Start bit
stream generators and send sampling pulses to reader output. Execute
basic machine cycle until receipt of stop hole pulse: Staticise counter
states onto relays. After a delay, reset counters and reset bit stream
generators to a new start position.

Colossus programming

All programmes hard wired, some permanently, some pluggable.
Conditional jumping possible between
alternative programmes depending on counter outputs.

The Rebuild

Work on the rebuild started two years
ago with the collection of all available information about Colossus,
including a series of official photographs taken in 1945.


The first
stage was to produce accurate machine drawings of the frames for
Colossus (all the original machine drawings had been burnt in 1960).
This involved three months of eyestrain pouring over the photographs and
using 3D projections to transfer the details to a CAD system, EasyCad
running on a 486 PC. 




Next problem was the optical paper tape reader system. The details
of this are not shown in any of the photographs. However I managed to
locate Dr Arnold Lynch who designed the reader system in 1942. Although
well into his 80's Dr Lynch came to my house and using my CAD system we
re-engineered the reader system to his original specifications. Then I
built it and here it is.




It uses original Colossus hard vacuum photocells, shown here on the
left and a mask onto which the image of the tape is projected by a
Colossus lense.



All the racks are now in place.

Here are some of the decade counters.

We are also rebuilding the Tunny machine.


The current state of Colossus: Jan 96

Examples of most
of the circuit panels are now working and the whole machine is working
at one bit level.


We are now rapidly cloning circuit panels to
populate all the racks.

I need lots more valves: EF36, 37 or 37A
pentodes, 6J5 triodes, 6V6 tetrodes and GT1C gas filled triode
thyratrons. The 6J5's and 6V6's should be the large glass versions to
look right.


Please send any contributions, valves or money,  to me (Tony Sale)

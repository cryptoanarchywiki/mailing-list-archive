Bush gang suspected in new assault on Presidency

by Edward Spannaus and Jeffrey Steinberg

In the midst of the worst global financial crisis in modern history, the
United States Presidency has come under renewed, vicious attack from a
combination of British and nominally ``American'' Bush-League circles.
This latest attack, which one White House official long ago
appropriately dubbed ``bimbo eruptions,'' centered around a Bush
``mole'' who was, unfortunately, allowed to operate inside the Clinton
administration, and who now enjoys high-level security clearances in her
post at the Pentagon.

Linda Tripp, the central player in the renewed assault against President
Clinton--staged around a purported sex scandal involving a young White
House intern, Monica Lewinsky--was a Bush administration employee from
1990, until Bush left office in January 1993. At the urging of senior
Bush administration officials, including Transportation Secretary Sam
Skinner, Tripp was retained by the Clinton-Gore transition team in a
clerical position, and later assigned to work at the Office of the White
House General Counsel, under Bernard Nussbaum and his deputy, Vincent
Foster. All the while, she was operating as part of a treasonous
Bush-League ``fifth column'' within the Executive branch.

While the ``Get Clinton'' media have attempted to portray Tripp as
``apolitical,'' she was, in fact, an ally, from the Bush administration
period on, of then-FBI agent Gary Aldrich, who, in 1996, wrote a
libellous book against President Clinton, {Unlimited Access: An FBI
Agent Inside the Clinton White House,} which also revolved around bogus
claims of White House sexual misconduct (see {EIR,} July 26, 1996,
p.|72.) Aldrich was another Bush-League mole inside the Clinton White
House. His embarrassingly fantasy-ridden book has been trumpetted by the
London-based Hollinger Corporation, the leading British Crown media
cartel; by its subsidiary, {American Spectator} magazine; and by ``Get
Clinton'' money-bags Richard Mellon Scaife.

Tripp emerged in 1995 as an asset of Whitewater Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr, testifying before the Whitewater grand jury and later
before a Congressional hearing on the death of Vincent Foster. When
Lloyd Cutler replaced Nussbaum as White House General Counsel, Tripp,
who by then had been widely identified as an unabashed political enemy
of President Clinton, was reassigned to the Pentagon, where she
eventually got an $80,000-a-year job, which also involved her getting
top-level security clearances. Tripp claimed, to anyone who would
listen, that she had been transferred from the White House because she
``knew too much about Whitewater,'' a patent lie.

Commenting on the role of Tripp as the linchpin in the latest
Clintongate assault, Lyndon LaRouche called on Jan. 22 for Tripp's
security clearances to be immediately revoked, pending the outcome of a
thorough probe of her role in the sordid affair. ``She obviously needs
her security clearances immediately pulled, given her role in what has
all the earmarks of an illegal attack against the President, ostensibly
on behalf of partisan Republican forces. I would certainly hope that
there is no one in the Pentagon who would countenance such an obvious
assault against a vital American institution, the Presidency. I would
expect such treachery from the editorial page writers at the {Wall
Street Journal,} but not from our military.''


               - An earlier `eruption' -


In the summer of 1997, Tripp surfaced again as part of an effort to hit
President Clinton with a ``Profumo''-style sex scandal, telling
{Newsweek} that the President had sexually harassed a White House aide,
Kathleen Willey. Willey denied, under oath, that Tripp's allegations
were true. This prompted President Clinton's attorney, Robert Bennett,
belatedly, in August 1997, to denounce Tripp as a liar.

While working at the Pentagon, in late 1996, Tripp had already begun to
cultivate a close relationship with a former White House junior staff
aide, 22-year-old Monica Lewinsky, who had been recently transferred to
the Defense Department. It is unclear how the two women came to meet,
but in short order, Tripp began to exert a significant amount of control
over the younger woman. Tripp should be forced, under oath, to detail
the circumstance under which she met and befriended Lewinsky.

Tripp soon betrayed Lewinsky's confidence by surreptitiously--and,
probably, illegally--taping telephone conversations with Lewinsky.

By December 1997, Tripp and Lewinsky had {both,} mysteriously, been
subpoenaed to give depositions to attorneys for Paula Jones, in her
civil lawsuit against the President--a lawsuit instigated by British
intelligence operator and former London {Sunday Telegraph} Washington
correspondent Ambrose Evans-Pritchard. How Jones's attorneys came to
know of the existence of Tripp and Lewinsky is one question that may
hold a key to Tripp's role in the present attack against the President.
It should be recalled that, prior to being named the independent counsel
in Whitewater, Kenneth Starr had been paid by Richard Mellon Scaife,
through the Landmark Legal Foundation, to prepare an {amicus curiae}
brief in support of Paula Jones.

Tripp claims that, on Jan. 12, 1998, she took 20 hours of tape-recorded
conversations with Lewinsky to Whitewater Special Prosecutor Starr. The
next day, Starr arranged for Tripp to secretly tape her meeting with
Lewinsky at the Ritz Carlton Hotel near the Pentagon in Arlington,
Virginia.

At the time that Starr arranged for the FBI to secretly tape the
Tripp-Lewinsky meeting, {he had absolutely no jurisdiction to probe
President Clinton's relationship to the former White House aide.}
Indeed, it is critical that a full-scale probe be conducted, to
determine whether Tripp, who was in league with Starr from 1995, was
taping her conversations with Lewinsky on her own, or, covertly, on
behalf of Starr. At minimum, Starr vastly overstepped his jurisdiction;
far more likely, he himself broke the law--along with Tripp--in a
flagrant attempt to entrap and destroy President Clinton.


                 - No U.S. precedent -


In the 200-year history of the American Presidency, there have been
occasional sexual scandals involving top government officials; however,
never has such a personal scandal brought down the chief executive.
There is only one country in the world where heads of government are
brought to their knees through such tabloid scandal-mongering: Great
Britain. In 1963, Harold Macmillan's government was brought down by a
sex scandal involving Defense Minister John Profumo.

It is, therefore, not surprising that a review of the various
Clintongate scandals, from the 1993 so-called ``Troopergate'' affair to
the present attack, reveals that British intelligence stringer and
former {Sunday Telegraph} Washington correspondent Ambrose
Evans-Pritchard has been the chief instigator. As early as May 8, 1994,
in a {Sunday Telegraph} column, Evans-Pritchard boasted that he had been
instrumental in getting Paula Jones to file her civil suit against the
President.

Evans-Pritchard has elsewhere boasted that his assignment, on behalf of
the British Crown's Hollinger Corporation, has been nothing less than
the total destruction of the Clinton Presidency. Writing in the Jan. 22
{Daily Telegraph,} Evans-Pritchard loudly bragged of his manipulation of
Paula Jones: ``My impression after befriending her four years ago,
before she took the momentous step of suing the President, is that her
motive was sheer rage.''

``Paula Jones has now achieved her object of inflicting massive damage
on Bill Clinton, with shortening odds that she may ultimately destroy
his Presidency,'' he continued. Evans-Pritchard accuses the U.S. news
media of covering up the Clinton sex scandals, so that only the
{American Spectator} or the British press will print the stories. ``What
Paula Jones has done is to use the immense power of legal discovery to
force the scandal to the surface. She has finally done the job that the
American media failed to do so miserably.''

This was precisely the strategy that Evans-Pritchard had laid out in
1994, when he acknowledged on May 8, 1994, that he had had ``a dozen
conversations with Mrs. Jones over the past two months.'' He furthermore
admitted that ``I happened to be present at a strategy meeting last
month on a boat on the Arkansas River,'' at which Jones's attorney ``was
weighing the pros and cons of legal action.''

It doesn't ``matter all that much whether Mrs. Jones ultimately wins or
loses her case,'' he wrote on May 15, 1994. ``The ticking time bomb in
the lawsuit lies elsewhere, in the testimony of other witnesses.''

``Put plainly,'' Evans-Pritchard blurted, ``the political purpose of the
Jones lawsuit is to reconstruct the inner history of the Arkansas
Governor's Mansion, using the legal power of discovery. In effect, the
two lawyers and their staff could soon be doing the job that the
American media failed to do during the election campaign and have
largely failed to do since.''

Evans-Pritchard's motive, in contrast to Jones's ``sheer rage,'' is a
deep, abiding hatred of the United States, and particularly, the
institution of its Presidency. Anyone who joins Evans-Pritchard in this
unfolding assault upon the Presidency, is joining the ranks of traitor
Aaron Burr.

A thorough probe of the current insurrection, beginning with a spotlight
on Linda Tripp, is more than appropriate.

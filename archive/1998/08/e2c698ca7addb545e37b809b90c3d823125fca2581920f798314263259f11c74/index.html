Dan Rather has a piece of Janet Reno appointing a special counsel to
investigate
Al Gorn tonight.

In legal terms, WE  may have a lawsuit ripening.

Read your stuff about ciphering

http://www.softwar.net/type59.html

Making money, other than way Al Gore APPARENTLY did with cryptography
through 
RSA, is tough.

Litigants WINNING a FOIA lawsuit get to charge the losers fees.

Morales and I ANNOUNCED to magistrate judge Don Svett our rate of  $100/
hr.

We have LOTS of time into the lawsuit seen at 
http://jya.com/whpfiles.htm  THOUSANDS of 
hours.  Morales and I want our money and out of that lawsuit.

Starting at 

http://www.worldnetdaily.com/smith/csindex.html

I saw your picture at 

http://www.worldnetdaily.com/smith/980818.comcs.html

You look young.

Morales is 60 and has WHITE HAIR.

I am 61 and EXPERIENCED.  I was ASSIGNED BY SANDIA to break electronic
locks for the FBI.

  It has been over about 27 years since I directed any Ph.D. students    
    
  http://www-hto.usc.edu/software/seqaln/doc/html/gfsr.3.html

Morales is A VERY CAREFUL THINKER.  Like

                   Sitting Bull, whose Indian name     
                   was Tatanka Iyotake, was born in     
                   the Grand River region of     
                   present-day South Dakota in     
                   approximately 1831. His nickname     
                   was Hunkesi, meaning "Slow"     
                   because he never hurried and did     
                   everything with care.      
     
http://www.incwell.com/Biographies/SittingBull.html     

Me too, I hope.

Morales and I received our nomination materials in the mail last
Saturday.  We need to submit required information.

  The Chrysler Award for Innovation in Design, now in its sixth year,
  honors outstanding designers (or design teams).  Winners are chosen
  from across the design disciplines by a judging panel of design
  leaders.  One the selection is made, Chrysler will award $10,000
  to each winner (or winning team) at a ceremony in New York in the
  Fall of 1998.  Award winners will be flown to New York for the 
  Award Ceremony.

involving Sandia/New Mexico is on the net.

Zeitgeist means the 'right time.'  

Doing anything before or after the 'right time' won't work.

Suing Sandia/DOE for the invoices RSA sent to Sandia might now be the
right time.

Think SLOWLY and CAREFULLY about what I write.  And $s, of course.  We
must have a 
PROPER MOTIVATION for all of this.

George B. Breznay, Director
Office of Hearings and Appeals
Department of Energy
Washington, DC 20585

Dear Director Breznay:

Purpose of this letter is to ask you to properly process a Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA) appeal.

I attach a copy of my Tuesday February 17, 1999 15:11 FOIA. letter to Elva Barfield.

Albuquerque  Journal w 8/5/98 reports

  FBI Director Again Calls for Fund-Raising Probe

  By Kevin Galvin
  The Associated Press

  WASHINGTON - The FBI director told lawmakers Tuesday an independent
  counsel should be named to investigate Democratic fund raising in
  part because President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore are
  under scrutiny. ...

June 11, 1998 I received a letter from Tomas O. Mann,  Deputy Director, Office of Hearings
Hearing and Appeals.

Mann wrote

  It is unclear from your correspondence whether you are in fact appealing Ms. Barfield's March 30
  determination at this time.  If you wish to appeal that determination, please inform this Office as soon
  as possible by stating your intention in writing, either by mail to George B. Breznay, Director, Office
  Office of Hearings and Appeals, U.S. Department of Energy, Washington, D.C. 20585-0107, or by
  e-mail to George.Breznay@hq.doe.gov.

I comply with Mann's request.

Since the contents of the documents sought in my FOIA may shed light on possible wrongdoing by
VP Al Gore, I ask that you process this appeal within the time limits specified by law.

  An agency is required to make a decision on an appeal
  within 20 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal
  holidays). It is possible for an agency to extend the time
  limits by an additional 10 days.


Sincerely,



William H. Payne

  Information SuperSpyWay 
  Al Gore Approved
  Encryption for China
  in Return for
  Campaign Donations
  by Charles R. Smith

Portions of the above document posted on Internet at 
http://www.us.net/softwar/ and  http://www.aci.net/kalliste/ 
states

1.	Gore charged with encryption policy according to PDD-5 and 
        PRD-27 on April 16, 1993. 

2.	Government officials represent themselves on Al Gore's behalf for 
	RSA patent purchase negotiations in Feb. 1994. 
3.	RSA chairman Bidzos meets with Chinese officials at the same 
        time as Ron Brown in Oct. 1995. 

4.	RSA Chairman Bidzos enters into merger negotiations with Security 
	Dynamics, a company backed by Sanford Robertson, in Nov. 1995. 

5.	VP Gore calls Sanford Robertson from the White House for a 
        donation in Nov. 1995. 

6.	Robertson delivers $100,000 donation ($80,000 soft - $20,000 
	directly into the Clinton/Gore campaign) in Jan. 1996. 
7.	RSA signs deal with China in Feb. 1996. The administration 
	previously prosecuted similar deals but this time does nothing. 
8.	Justice Dept. approves RSA merger with Security Dynamics in 
	April 1996 for $280 million dollars, netting Sanford Robertson's 
	company a cool $2 million just to write the deal. 

In 1991 I was in involved with Sandia National Laboratories
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty seismic data authenticator.

At that time Sandia director Tommy A Sellers had assumed 
responsibility for directorship from Robert Clem.

Sandia supervisor Tom Wright replaced my supervisor, John Holovka, 
who was the supervisor for the CTBT seismic data authenticator.

Wright brought in Ph.D. Steven Goldsmith to supervise me.

Sellars, Wright, and Goldsmith were new to crypto-type projects.

Much of this is documented at http://www.jya.com/whp021598.htm.

This is evidenced by Sellar's attached SEP 24 1991 memorandum,
which Goldsmith help author, addressed to Dr James J Hearn at 
the National Security Agency.

The SEP 24 memorandum contained a number of technical errors.

I corrected these errors in my attached December 20, 1991 memorandum.

Department of Energy and it predecessors have a well-documented
history of not requiring technical expertise for pursuit of interests.

Stewart Udall, The Myths of August, writes,

    Any cover-up must be implemented and enforced by designated
  agents, and one man emerged in 1953 as the quarterback of the 
  AEC's damage-control effort.  His name was Gordon Dunning.
  Although the personnel charts of the 1950s list him as a low-level 
  "rad-safe" official in the Division of Biology and Medicine,           
  documents demonstrate that he was clothed with authority to    
  manage and suppress information about the radiation released
  by the testing of nuclear weapons. ...

About the time Sellers and Sandia Ombudsman gave me a directed
transfer to break electronic locks for the FBI/ERF [engineering
research facility], Goldsmith and Wright, certainly with the approval
of Sellers, placed a contract with RSA Inc [http://www.rsa.com/], 
I was told.

Ms Barfield, we think the American public needs to know more about
RSA's work with Sandia National Laboratories.

Therefore, Under the provision of the Freedom of Information Act, 
5 USC 552, I am requesting access to: 

  1 ALL purchase requisitions, including any attached statement of
    work, issued by Sandia National Laboratories, Los Alamos     
    National Laboratories, or DOE/ALOO between January 1, 1991
    and February 17, 1998 to RSA Inc.

  2  Copies of all invoices from RSA Inc received by Sandia National   
     Laboratories, Los Alamos National Laboratories, or DOE/ALOO 
     between January 1, 1991  and February 17, 1998

If there are any fees for searching for, or copying, the records 
I have requested, please inform me before you fill the request.

As you know, the Act permits you to reduce or waive the fees 
when the release of the information is considered as "primarily 
benefiting the public."  I believe that this requests fits that 
category and I therefore ask that you waive any fees.

Your office agreed to waive fees before.  This request is surely 
of "public interest."

December 13, 1994 DOE/AL FOIA officer Gwen Schreiner waived fees
for the reason,

        "We have considered your request and have determined that
        release of the requested records is in the public interest,
        that disclosure of this information is likely to contribute
        significantly to public understanding of the operations or
        activities of the government, that you or the organization
        you represent have little or no commercial interest in the
        material contained in the records, that you or the
        organization you represent have the qualifications and
        ability to use and disseminate the information, and that the
        records are not currently in the public domain.  A waiver of
        fees is therefore granted."

This waiver of fees was, undoubtedly, issued as a result of former
Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary's Openness initiative.

Heart of America paid my way to hear Secretary O'Leary's celebrated
whistleblower speech.

If all or any part of this request is denied, please cite the 
specific exemption(s) which you think justifies your refusal to 
release the information and inform me of your agency's 
administrative appeal procedures available to me under the law.

I would appreciate your handling this request as quickly as 
possible, and I look forward to hearing from you within 20 
working days, as the law stipulates.

Sincerely,

Counterfeiting Wiegand Wire Access Credentials
     
                                   Bill Payne
     
                                 October 16,1996
     
                                    Abstract
     
                  Wiegand wire access credentials are easy and
                  inexpensive to counterfeit.
     
        Access Control &amp; Security Systems Integration magazine, October
        1996 [http://www/securitysolutions.com] published the article,
     
             Wiegand technology stands the test of time
     
             by PAUL J. BODELL, page 12
     
             Many card and reader manufacturers offer Wiegand (pronounced
             wee-gand) output.  However, only three companies in the
             world make Wiegand readers.  Sensor Engineering of Hamden
             Conn., holds the patent for Wiegand, and Sensor has licensed
             Cardkey of Simi Valley, Calif., and Doduco of Pforzheim,
             Germany, to manufacture Wiegand cards and readers. ...  A
             Wiegand output reader is not the same thing as a Wiegand
             reader,  and it is important to understand the differences.
     
                In brief, Wiegand reader use the Wiegand effect to
             translate card information around the patented Wiegand
             effect in which a segment of a specially treated wire
             generates an electronic pulse when subjected to a specific
             magnetic field.  If the pulse is generated when the wire is
             near a pick-up coil, the pulse can be detected by a circuit.
             Lining up several rows of wires and passing them by a cold
             would generate a series of pulses.  Lining up two rows of
             wires - calling on row "zero bits" and the other "one bits"
             - and passing them by two different coils would generate two
             series of pulses, or data bits.  These data bits can then be
             interpreted as binary data and used to control other
             devices.  If you seal the coils in a rugged housing with
             properly placed magnets, and LED and some simple circuitry,
             you have a Wiegand reader.  Carefully laminate the special
             wires in vinyl, and artwork, and hot-stamp a number on the
             vinyl, and you have a Wiegand card.
     
             IN THE BEGINNING
     
               Wiegand was first to introduce to the access control
             market in the late 1970s.  It was immediately successful
             because it filled the need for durable, secure card and
             reader technology.
               Embedded in the cards, Wiegand wires cannot be altered or
             duplicated. ...
     
        Bodell's Last statement is incorrect.
     
        Tasks for EASILY counterfeiting Wiegand wire cards are
     
        1    Locate the wires inside the card to read the 0s and 1s.
     
        2    Build an ACCEPTABLE copy of the card.
     
        Bodell's clear explanation of the working of a Wiegand card can
        be visualized
     
             zero row    |     |   |
     
             one row        |          |
     
             binary      0  1  0   0   1
             representation
     
        Solutions to Task 1
     
             A    X-ray the card
     
             B    MAGNI VIEW FILM,  Mylar film reads magnetic fields ...
                  Edmunds Scientific Company, catalog 16N1, page
                  205, C33,447  $11.75
     
        is placed over the top of the Wiegand card.
     
        COW MAGNET,  Cow magnetics allow farmers to trap metal in the
        stomachs of their cows.  Edmunds, page 204, C31,101 $10.75
        is placed under the card.
     
        Location of the wires is easily seen on the green film.
     
        Mark the position of the wires with a pen.
     
        Next chop the card vertically using a shear into about 80/1000s
        paper-match-sized strips.
     
        Don't worry about cutting a wire or two.
     
        Note that a 0 has the pen mark to the top.  A 1 has the pen mark
        at the bottom.
     
        Take a business card and layout the "paper match"-like strips to
        counterfeit the card number desired.
     
        Don't worry about spacing.  Wiegand output is self-clocking!
     
        Tape the "paper-match - like" strips to the business card.
     
        Only the FUNCTION of the card needs to be reproduced!
     
                                     History
     
        Breaking electronic locks was done as "work for others" at Sandia
     
        National Laboratories beginning in 1992 funded by the Federal
        Bureau of Investigation/Engineering Research Facility, Quantico,

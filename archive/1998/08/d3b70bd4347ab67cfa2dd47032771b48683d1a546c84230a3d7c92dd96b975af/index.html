Our research indicates the following material may be of interest
to you. If you prefer NOT to learn the easy way to make some much
needed income, please, simply delete this letter. To further
insure you do not get email of this nature, there are several
universal "remove" lists you can subscribe to on the internet.
I filter all email addresses that I send to against such a
"remove" list of over 2,000,000 subscribers.

Please accept my apology if this was sent to you in error!

***************************************************************
You are about to make up to $50,000-In less than 90 days
Read the enclosed program...THEN READ IT AGAIN!
***************************************************************
This is the letter that got my attention. Read on and I'm sure
you will agree that this is a great plan!


Dear Friend,

The enclosed information is something I almost let slip through
my Fingers. Fortunately, sometime later I re-read everything and
gave some thought and study to it. Please do the same. It's so
simple to do.

And you won't be left out in the cold to figure it all out yourself.
Look further down in this letter for the information you will
receive from Abot Marketing. They give you 10,000 fresh email
addresses and give you the locations of the best software (FREE
SOFTWARE) to send out large quantities of email. (normally this
kind of software is several hundred dollars) They even give you
easy to understand, proven, step by step instructions for success
with this program. In fact, they helped me get started and I'm
so thankful. It's hard to belive that this as simple as it is,
but it really is SIMPLE. You will even get support from them via
email anytime you need it. You won't get this kind of help from
other programs of this nature. It makes all the difference in the world.


My name is Anne Bowman. I am 31-year-old graduate student desperately
trying to finish my degree and begin working in my chosen field
that is, if I am lucky enough to find a job in the crowded market.
Like most people in this day and age, it is hard to make ends
meet, and being a student does not help the situation at all
(If I ever have to buy one more box of macaroni and cheese I
think I would have to scream). I returned to school after
having worked for several years with little potential for
achieving what I had expected out of life. I figured if I
returned to school and received my Ph.D there would be several
pportunities for me out there to achieve my goals. After seeing
my fellow graduate students receive their degrees and,
depressingly, not find respectable positions in their chosen
field I began to think, "Oh no not again!" Four extra years
in school and an extra $20,000 in student loans on top of the
first $18,000, what will I do if the same happens to me?"
I began to doubt my patience for the long term investment in
schooling, and decided enough was enough, "Why can't I make
real money now instead of waiting to graduate with no guarantee
of a lucrative return for all of my efforts!" I am writing to
share my experience with other hopeful students out there, as
well as ANYONE looking for an pportunity to take their financial
situation into their own hands. I hope you will consider this
opportunity seriously and that this will change your life FOREVER!
., FINANCIALLY!!! And once you get started it takes so little
of your time.

In mid October 97 I received this program. I didn't send for it,or
ask for it, they just got my name off a mailing list. I TOOK THIS
AS A SIGN!!! After reading it several times, to make sure I was
reading it correctly, it made perfect sense. Here was a MONEY-MAKING
PHENOMENON. I could invest as much as I wanted to start (about as
much as it costs for a pizza!), without putting me further in debt.
After I got a pencil and paper and figured it out, I would at least
get my money back. After determining that the program is LEGAL and
NOT A CHAIN LETTER, I decided "I HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE".

Initially I sent 15,000 emails, (without any costs to me) only a couple
of hours of my time on-line. The great thing about email is that I didn't
need any money for printing to send out the program, only the time to
fulfill my orders. There is a vast on-line market available to everyone
who owns a computer. Following the advice of the person from whom I
received
this letter, I am telling you like it is, and I hope it doesn't turn you
off, but I promised myself I would not "rip-off" anyone, no matter how much
money it cost me! After you receive the reports they should explain
everything to you. You may have some general questions, however, and after
I send you REPORT #1 , please feel free to contact me and I will give
you any advice you need.

In one week, I was starting to receive orders for REPORT #1.
By mid November, I had received 40 orders for REPORT #1. When you read the
GUARANTEE in the program you will see that "YOU MUST RECEIVE 15 TO 20
ORDERS
FOR REPORT #1 WITHIN 2 WEEKS IF YOU DON'T SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU
DO!" My first step in making $50,000 in 20 to 90 days was done. By the
beginning of December, I had received 174 orders for REPORT #2. If you go
back to the GUARANTEE. "YOU MUST RECEIVE 100 OR MORE ORDERS FOR REPORT #2
WITHIN TWO WEEKS. IF NOT SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO. ONCE YOU HAVE
100 ORDERS, THE REST IS EASY, RELAX, YOU WILL MAKE YOUR $50,000 GOAL".
Well,
I had 174 orders for REPORT #2, 74 more than I needed. So I sat back and
relaxed. By January 20th, of my emailing of 15,000, I received $54,000 with
more coming in ever day. The great thing about this program is you can
begin the process over and over again without any limit on potential
income!

I paid off ALL my student loans, and together with everything I have
learned
in school, I am now saving in order to open up my own business related to
my field as soon as I graduate. Please take time to read the attached
program. IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER! Remember, it won't work if you
don't try it. This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY!
Especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place
on the list. It doesn't work, you'll lose out on a lot of money! REPORT #2
explains this. ALWAYS follow the guarantee, 15 to 20 orders of REPORT #1
and 100 or more orders for REPORT #2 and you will make $50,000 or more in
20 to 90 days. I AM LIVING PROOF THAT IT WORKS!!

If you choose not to participate in this program, I'm sorry, It really
is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you. If you choose
to participate, follow the program and you will be on your way to
financial security.

To my fellow graduate students out there, good luck to you and I
sympathize. And to all other persons in financial trouble consider
this letter a sign and please take advantage of this opportunity.
YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!


Sincerely,
Anne Bowman

The following testimonial was at the bottom of this letter but it
was too good to leave down there so I moved it up here. It is
exactly how I felt at first and and feel now.

"The first week after I started this program was torture.
I couldnt wait to see if it was really going to work after I mailed
out my first batch of letters. I chuckle every day now when I walk
out of the post office with my envelopes. This is so easy, I still
can't belive it's happenning!" Don Masterson, Troy,NY


$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

&gt;From here down is the instruction portion of this letter...

This is a LEGAL, MONEY-MAKING PHENOMENON. PRINT this letter, read the
directions, THEN READ IT AGAIN !!!

You are about to embark on the most profitable and unique program you may 
ever see. Many times over, it has demonstrated and proven its ability to
generate large amounts of cash. This program is showing fantastic appeal
with a huge and ever-growing on-line population desirous of additional
income.

This is a legitimate, LEGAL, money-making opportunity. It does not require
you to
come in contact with people, do any hard work, and best of all, you never
have to
leave the house, except to get the mail and go to the bank! 

This truly is that lucky break you've been waiting for! Simply follow the
easy
instructions in this letter, and your financial dreams will come true! When
followed
correctly, this electronic, multi-level marketing program works
perfectly...100%
EVERY TIME! 

Thousands of people have used this program to:
- Raise capital to start their own business
- Pay off debts
- Buy homes, cars, etc., 
- Even retire! 

This is your chance, so don't pass it up!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------
OVERVIEW OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY ELECTRONIC 
MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING PROGRAM
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------

Basically, this is what we do:

We send thousands of people a product for $5.00 that costs next to 
nothing to produce and e-mail. As with all multi-level businesses, we
build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products.
Every state in the U.S. allows you to recruit new multi- level business 
online (via your computer).

The products in this program are a series of four business and financial
reports costing $5.00 each. Each order you receive via "snail mail" will
include:

* $5.00 cash
* The name and number of the report they are ordering
* The e-mail address where you will e-mail them the report they ordered.

To fill each order, you simply e-mail the product to the buyer. The $5.00
is yours!
This is the most EASIEST electronic multi-level marketing business
anywhere!

FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER AND
BE PREPARED TO REAP THE STAGGERING BENEFITS!

******* I N S T R U C T I O N S *******

This is what you MUST do:

1. Order all 4 reports shown on the list below (you can't sell them if you
don't order them).

* For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME &amp; NUMBER OF THE 
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR
RETURN POSTAL ADDRESS (in case of a problem) to the person whose 
name appears on the list next to the report.

* When you place your order, make sure you order each of the four
reports. You will need all four reports so that you can save them
on your computer and resell them.

* Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the four
reports. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible
for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from
you.

2. IMPORTANT-- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed
next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other
than is instructed below in steps "a" through "d" or you will lose out
on the majority of your profits. ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND THE WAY THIS
WORKS, YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHY IT DOESN'T WORK IF YOU CHANGE IT. 
Remember,
this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will not work.

a. Look below for the listing of available reports.

b. After you've ordered the four reports, replace the name and address
under REPORT #1 with your name and address, moving the one that 
was there down to REPORT #2. 

c. Move the name and address that was under REPORT #2 down to 
REPORT #3. 

d. Move the name and address that was under REPORT #3 down to 
REPORT #4. 

e. The name and address that was under REPORT #4 is removed from
the list and has NO DOUBT collected their 50 grand.

Please make sure you copy everyone's name and address ACCURATELY!!!

3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, and save
it to your computer. Make NO changes to the INSTRUCTION portion of
this letter. 

4. Now you're ready to start an advertising campaign on the
Internet! Advertising on the Internet is very, very
inexpensive, and there are HUNDREDS of FREE places to
advertise, but email has, by far, proven itself to be the best medium
for
this program. And the emailers best friend is e-mail lists.
You can buy these lists for under $20/20,000 addresses or you can pay
someone a minimal charge to take care of the mailing for you. BE SURE
TO START 
YOUR AD CAMPAIGN IMMEDIATELY! Each day that passes while you think
about 
it is a day without profit. 

5. For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report
they ordered. THAT'S IT! ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE 
ON ALL ORDERS! This will guarantee that the e-mail THEY send out,
with YOUR name and address on it, will be prompt because they can't
advertise until they receive the report!

------------------------------------------
AVAILABLE REPORTS

*****IMPORTANT NOTE*****
My personal success is due to sending out emails to prospective
participants, I am happy to help you get started by giving you
10,000 free current email addresses and giving you the location
of several free programs that will allow you to send out large
quantities of e-mail easily. I will email the fresh addresses
and software information to you the same day I receive your
report request. Just jot down "free help please" on the report
request that you send with your $5. In many cases I can take
care of your mailing for you at NO CHARGE. You will receive my
real email address when I send you this report and you can contact
me for any questions you may have. (program participants, you may
leave this offer with my name as I am moved down the list. I will
honor it for the duration of the program. Just move it down, with my 
name, to the next position when you send out your first mailings.) 
_________________________________________________________________


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PLAN WILL MAKE YOU $MONEY$
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Let's say you decide to start small just to see how well it works. Assume
your goal is to get 10 people to participate on your first level. (Placing
a lot of FREE ads on the Internet will EASILY get a larger response.) Also
assume that everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 down line
members. Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING results below.

1st level--your 10 members with$5...................................$50
2nd level--10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100)..................$500
3rd level--10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000)..........$5,000
4th level--10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10,000)...$50,000
THIS TOTALS-----------&gt;$55,550

Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate only
recruit 10 people each. Think for a moment what would happen if they
got 20 people to participate! Most people get 100's of participants! 
THINK ABOUT IT!

Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you can
afford $20 for a chance to make $ 55,000). You obviously already have
an Internet connection and e-mail is FREE!!! REPORT# 3 shows you the
most productive methods for bulk e-mailing and purchasing e-mail lists.
Some list &amp; bulk e-mail vendors even work on trade!

About 50,000 new people get online every month!

*******TIPS FOR SUCCESS*******

* TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS! Be prompt, professional, and follow 
the directions accurately.

* Send for the four reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them when 
the orders start coming in because:

When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the requested
product/report to comply with the U.S. Postal &amp; Lottery Laws, Title
18,Sections 1302 and 1341 or Title 18, Section 3005 in the U.S. Code,
also Code of Federal Regs. Vol.. 16, Sections 255 and 436, which
state that "a product or service must be exchanged for money received."

* ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE.

* Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow the 
instructions exactly, the results WILL undoubtedly be SUCCESSFUL!

* ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED!

*******YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINE*******

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:
I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH HOW IMPORTANT THIS NEXT SECTION IS!!!!

If you don't receive 10 to 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks,
continue advertising until you do. Then, a couple of weeks later you
should receive at least 10

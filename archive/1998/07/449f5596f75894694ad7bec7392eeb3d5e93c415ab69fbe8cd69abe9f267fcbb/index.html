And though the
murderers may escape the just resentment of an enraged people; though
drowsy justice, intoxicated by the poisonous draught prepared for her
cup, still nods upon her rotten seat, yet be assured such complicated
crimes will meet their due reward.

Standing armies are sometimes (I would by no
means say generally, much less universally) composed of persons who
have rendered themselves unfit to live in civil society; who have no
other
motives of conduct than those which a desire of the present gratification
of
their passions suggests; who have no property in any country; men who
have given up their own liberties, and envy those who enjoy liberty;
who
are equally indifferent to the glory of a George or a Louis; who, for
the
addition of one penny a day to their wages, would desert from the
Christian cross and fight under the crescent of the Turkish Sultan.
From
such men as these, what has not a State to fear? With such as these,
usurping Caesar passed the Rubicon; with such as these, he humbled
mighty Rome, and forced the mistress of the world to own a master in
a
traitor. These are the men whom sceptred robbers now employ to frustrate
the designs of God, and render vain the bounties which his gracious
hand
pours indiscriminately upon his creatures. By these the miserable slaves
in
Turkey, Persia, and many other extensive countries, are rendered truly
wretched, though their air is salubrious, and their soil luxuriously
fertile. By
these, France and Spain, though blessed by nature with all that administers
to the convenience of life, have been reduced to that contemptible
state in
which they now appear
But since standing armies are so hurtful to a State, perhaps my
countrymen may demand some substitute, some other means of rendering
us secure against the incursions of a foreign enemy. But can you be
one
moment at a loss? Will not a well-disciplined militia afford you ample
security against foreign foes? We want not courage; it is discipline
alone in
which we are exceeded by the most formidable troops that ever trod
the
earth. 
A well-disciplined militia is a safe, an
honorable guard to a community like this, whose inhabitants are by
nature
brave, and are laudably tenacious of that freedom in which they were
born.
&gt;From a well-regulated militia we have nothing to fear; their interest
is the
same with that of the State. When a country is invaded, the militia
are
ready to appear in its defense; they march into the field with that
fortitude
which a consciousness of the justice of their cause inspires; they
do not
jeopard their lives for a master who considers them only as the instruments
of his ambition, and whom they regard only as the daily dispenser of
the
scanty pittance of bread and water. No; they fight for their houses,
their
lands, for their wives, their children; for all who claim the tenderest
names,
and are held dearest in their hearts; they fight pro aris et focis,
for their
liberty, and for themselves, and for their God. 

I cannot here forbear noticing the
signal manner in which the designs of those who wish not well to us
have
been discovered. The dark deeds of a treacherous cabal have been
brought to public view. ou now know the serpents who, whilst cherished
in your bosoms, were darting the envenomed stings into the vitals of
the
constitution. But the representatives of the people have fixed a mark
on
these ungrateful monsters,

Surely you never will tamely suffer this country to be a den of thieves.

Break in sunder, with noble disdain, the bonds with which the
Philistines have bound you. Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed, by
the
soft arts of luxury and effeminacy, into the pit digged for your destruction.
Despise the glare of wealth. That people who pay greater respect to
a
wealthy villain than to an honest, upright man in poverty, almost deserve
to
be enslaved; they plainly show that wealth, however it may be acquired,
is,
in their esteem, to be preferred to virtue. 

The virtuous asserter of the rights of
mankind merits a reward, which even a want of success in his endeavors
to
save his country, the heaviest misfortune which can befall a genuine
patriot,
cannot entirely prevent him from receiving. 
{Timothy McVeigh - sog}

Secret Service
the start of the Spanish-American War led to the first legal use of
the Secret
Service for Presidential protection. A detail of four agents, operating
under special emergency was
fund, was assigned to the Executive Mansion to guard McKinley around
the clock. They were
stationed on the first and second floors of the Mansion and on the
White House grounds. [13]

[13 During the Spanish-American War, the Secret Service also served
as the primary intelligence
agency for the War Departnent. It gathered intelligence and conducted
counter espionage activities
both domestically and abroad.]

72

After the war, Secret Service operatives continued to serve at the
White House at least part
of the time. In addition, operatives regularly accompanied McKinley
during his travels. With the
expiration of the emergency war fund these activities once again exceeded
the Secret Service's
statutory authority. However, Secret Service Chief John Wilkie felt
obligated to provide the
protection anyway. President McKinley received a large number of threats,
which seemed
particularly credible in light of a series of political assassinations
that took place in Europe during
this period.

In 1901, President McKinley was shot and fatally wounded by anarchist
Leon Czolgosz
while standing in a receiving line at the Pan American Exposition in
Buffalo, New ork. Three
Secret Service operatives were guarding him at the time, along with
eighteen exposition policemen,
eleven members of the Coast Guard, and four Buffalo city detectives.
One of the Secret Service
operatives was out of position when Czolgosz approached President McKinley,
because the
president of the exposition d requested the spot directly next to MdCinley,
where the operative
normally stood.

, in 1906, Congress quietly included language in the Sundry Civil Expenses
Act authorizing
the Secretary of the Treasury to use funds for "the protection of theperson
of the President of the
United States."
{Treasury=Money=Illuminatti - sog}

Since the Secret Service was officially
authorized to provide protective services in 1906, only one person
has been killed under its watch
- President John F. Kennedy, who was fatally wounded by Lee Harvey
Oswald while riding in a
motorcade through Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963.

Since the inception of the Secret Service, however, there also have
been six other
potentially deadly assaults on Secret Service protectees.

The first occurred on February 1, 1933, in Miami, Florida Giuseppe
Zangara fired five
shots a President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was making an impromptu
speech while sitting
in an open car that had stopped momentarily. Although none of the shots
hit President Roosevelt,
Zangara mortally wounded Anton Cermak, the Mayor of Chicago, and hit
four other people,
including a Secret Service agent.

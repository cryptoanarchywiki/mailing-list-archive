DATA FELLOWS ANNOUNCES F-SECURE WORKSTATION SUITE 3.0

The World's First Suite Product with Strong Encryption Provides
Corporations with a Complete Security Solution 

HELSINKI, FINLAND, July 27, 1998  -- Data Fellows, a leading developer of
data security solutions, today announced F-Secure Workstation Suite. The
product provides a reliable and easy-to-manage solution for most data
security concerns of modern corporations. 

"F-Secure Workstation Suite provides centralized management of most
corporate security aspects," says Mr. Risto Siilasmaa, Chief Executive
Officer of Data Fellows. "It combines world-class protection against
malicious code with unobtrusive file and network encryption. F-Secure
Workstation Suite is easily integrated into the enterprise's management
system. The Suite is also totally unobtrusive for the corporate end-users."

F-Secure Workstation Suite is the only product to combine world-class 
anti-virus protection with strong encryption for network traffic and files
stored on the hard disk. Competing offerings from Network Associates and
Symantec are not available world-wide with strong encryption. They also
lack the centralized policy based management features announced for
F-Secure Workstation Suite 4.0.

Unparalleled Virus Protection

The components of F-Secure Workstation Suite utilize the absolute latest
technology in the field. Malicious code detection and removal is based on
the F-Secure Anti-Virus product line, the first anti-virus in the world to
use multiple scanning engines simultaneously through its revolutionary
CounterSign architecture. Its detection rates are unparalleled, and
automated updates to the whole network further enhance its reliability.

Real-Time File Encryption and IPsec-Based Network Encryption

F-Secure Workstation Suite is the only suite product currently available to
offer strong encryption all over the world. The product uses an encryption
key length of 128 bits or more. The administrator can choose from supported
algorithms, including RSA, 3DES and Blowfish. All the most widely used
authentication methods are supported.

Should the authorized user forget his/her password, the product also
contains a safe and easy administrative key retrieval function.

"The file encryption component of F-Secure Workstation Suite provides
real-time protection for confidential data. F-Secure FileCrypto
automatically encrypts all open and temporary files. Not only is encryption
completely unobtrusive to the end-user, but it is also extremely secure:
there is no way the user can accidentally store confidential information in
plain text," explains Mr. Siilasmaa.

F-Secure Workstation Suite's network encryption, F-Secure VPN+, is based on
the latest IPsec standards. The F-Secure VPN+ is fully scalable: it
contains three components (Client, Server and Gateway) which can be
combined to build all major types of virtual private networks. These
include connections between organizations and their partners, home offices,
or employees on the road. F-Secure VPN+ is also fully transparent to the
end-user, as it uses IP protocol at the network level, which is invisible
at the application level. The 
F-Secure Workstation Suite product contains the client component of 
F-Secure VPN+. The Server and Gateway components are available separately.

Availability

The first version of F-Secure Workstation Suite will operate in the
Microsoft Windows NT environment. The product will be available from the
Data Fellows resellers around the world in August 1998. Prices will start
from $68 per seat for a 100-user license. 

The 4.0 version will be available in early fourth quarter 1998. This
version will be a fully integrated, policy-based security solution, making
it possible to manage data security issues in accordance with the corporate
security policy. The product will be based on a three tier management
architecture with considerable scalability advantages in a large
organization. In addition to Microsoft Windows NT, it will also operate in
the Microsoft Windows 95 and Windows 98 environments. 

All users of F-Secure Workstation Suite 3.0 will receive a free upgrade to
the 4.0 version as it ships.

Easy-to-Use Management and Scalability

The installation of F-Secure Workstation Suite 4.0 requires no work at the
actual workstation, and no configuration from the end-user after the
installation. The entire corporate system can be managed centrally. Thus
the management of vital security issues is effective but completely
transparent to the end-user. F-Secure Workstation Suite supports the
industry-standard SNMP protocol, integrates with Microsoft Systems
Management Server (SMS) and will include agents for leading enterprise
management products, such as CA Unicenter, IBM Tivoli and HP OpenView.

F-Secure Workstation Suite 4.0 comes bundled with F-Secure Administrator, a
Pure Java based graphical console for managing the security policies for
the whole enterprise network.

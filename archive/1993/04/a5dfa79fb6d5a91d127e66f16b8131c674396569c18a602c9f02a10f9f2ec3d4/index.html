Here's some stuff I dug up on Mykotronyx.
 
The are privately held (at least there are no SEC filings on the database).
I also checked the patent database, but it came up empty.
 
Note the discrepency in the first two entries:  one lists sales
of $252,900,000 and the other says $2,500,000.
 
"Myko" apparently means "enchantress" in Japanese.

HEADLINE:  Mykotronx  develops "Clipper" chip designed to ensure
communications
privacy
 
DATELINE: TORRANCE, Calif.
 
 BODY:
   "Securing the world of communications bit by bit" is not only the motto
but
the guiding philosophy of  Mykotronx  Inc., a Torrance small business
specializing in the design and manufacture of unique digital components and
equipment.
 
    Mykotronx  Monday announced the introduction of an electronic chip --
designated "Clipper" -- that it believes will ensure the protection of
sensitive
information transmitted via cellular or regular phones, computer networks or
fax
machines. This chip and follow-ons will also find application in many other
systems, e.g., cable TV and personal computers.
 
   Leonard J. Baker, president of  Mykotronx,  said: "This chip is a good
example of the transfer of military technology to the commercial and general
government fields with handsome cost benefits. For 15 years we have been
evolving this technology to protect government and commercial spacecraft
from
being tampered with and to protect the data transmitted by the spacecraft to
its
ground users. This technology should now pay big dividends to U.S.
taxpayers."
 
   Economic data of incalculable value is transmitted each day over various
telecommunications media, including telephones, facsimiles, telex, cable and
other communications networks. Each message is vulnerable to interception
through relatively simple techniques.
 
   Exploitation of illegally obtained information can do tremendous damage
to
the parties involved, ranging from embarrassment to the loss of hundreds of
millions of dollars to a hacker who knows the specifics of a competitor's
business plans.
 
   Said Baker: "Just as technology provides the means for communicating the
data, it can now minimize the threat of its loss."
 
   It is in this arena that the chip developed by  Mykotronx  comes into
play.
It contains an ENCODE and DECODE capability using the government's recently
announced new algorithm (more than 16 million times more keys than available
on
DES -- the existing system) to defeat hackers or eavesdroppers attempting to
intercept voice or data messages.
 
   This first of a series of  Mykotronx  chips, developed by a team under
the
direction of Richard J. Takahashi, vice president of engineering, has been
delivered to AT&amp;T for use in its Telephone Security Device (TSD). This
device,
 PAGE    3
                         Business Wire, April 19, 1993
   
 
placed between the handset and base of an ordinary telephone, allows the
encryption and decryption of conversations so that eavesdropping cannot
occur.
 
   This inexpensive capability will first be utilized by government agencies
to
protect sensitive conversations. A similar chip has been delivered to
Motorola
for use in its secure telephone products and digital radios. More advanced
chips, those that protect other data transmissions, will be available in the
coming months.
 
   These chips are manufactured by VLSI Technology Inc. of San Jose, Calif.,
using its unique FSB technology. VLSI was selected by  Mykotronx  based on
its
ability to develop high-performance semiconductor chips.
 
    Mykotronx,  a.k.a. Myko, was founded by Robert E. Gottfried and Kikuo
Ogawa
to develop cryptographic units to protect the communication channels between
spacecraft and ground stations. The company has delivered equipment to the
Department of Defense, NASA and most aerospace companies.
 
   The strength of  Mykotronx  lies in its people and their unrelenting
drive
for excellence. Their "can-do" attitude has allowed the company to deliver
high-quality products on very short time schedules.   Mykotronx  has
received
numerous commendations for its quality program and was recently named
"Supplier
of the Year" for the second consecutive year by IBM's Federal Systems Co. of
Boulder, Colo.
 
   Sales of more than $5 million in 1992 are expected to double in 1993.
Transferring this technology from spacecraft to everyday uses will allow the
company to fulfill its ambitious motto of "Securing the world of
communications
bit by bit."

Droge,

HEADLINE: AT&amp;T TO INCORPORATE NEW 'CLIPPER' CHIP INTO SECURE COMMUNICATIONS
PRODUCT LINE
 
DATELINE: GREENSBORO, N.C., April 16
 
KEYWORD: bc-AT&amp;T-Clipper-chip 
 
 BODY:
    AT&amp;T (NYSE: T) said today it is moving to improve the security and
privacy
of telephone communications by incorporating a just-announced new U.S.
government technology for voice encryption into its secure communications
product line.
 
   AT&amp;T will use the Clipper chip, announced today by President Clinton as a
new
technology for voice encryption, in all of its secure telephone products
except
those specially designed for government classified customers.  The Commerce
Department has announced a six-month timetable for the final certification
of
Clipper.
 
   "AT&amp;T is pleased to be the first company to publicly commit to adoption
of
the Clipper chip," said Ed Hickey, AT&amp;T vice president, Secure
Communications
Systems.  "We believe it will give our customers far greater protection in
defeating hackers or eavesdroppers attempting to intercept a call.
 
   "And now all commercially available AT&amp;T voice encryption products will
be
compatible with each other, a major step forward in bringing secure
communications capabilities to the business community."
 
   In standardizing AT&amp;T voice encryption products on the Clipper chip, AT&amp;T
will include the algorithm in the Telephone Security Device as well as in
the
Secure Voice/Data Terminal.
 
   The AT&amp;T Telephone Security Device is a compact, lightweight unit that
brings
advance encryption technology to conventional land-line and cellular
telephones.
It provides a powerful, convenient and reliable way to protect the most
sensitive telephone conversations.
 
   The device works with a conventional land-line or transportable/mobile
cellular phone.  It turns the phone's signal into a digital stream of
encrypted
information that is decrypted by a Telephone Security Device attached to the
phone at the receiving end of the call.
 
   The AT&amp;T Telephone Security Device connects easily to desk telephones or
tranportable or mobile phones.  It weighs 1.5 poun                 PAGE    5
                          PR Newswire, April 16, 1993
   
 
inches wide and 1.5 inches high.  And it's as easy to use as it is portable.
 
   The AT&amp;T Secure Voice/Data Terminals are desktop telephones that provide
encryption for both telephone calls and data transmissions.
 
   These AT&amp;T secure communications products use an enhanced voice
encryption
technique that provides very high voice quality.  This technology allows
calls
placed with these products to approach the voice quality of normal calls.
 
   To further enhance interoperability, AT&amp;T will consider licensing to
other
manufacturers its enabling technologies for interoperability.
Interoperability
of encryption devices requires common technology beyond the use of a common
encryption algorithm, specifically common methods of digital voice encoding
and
signaling.
 
   AT&amp;T has already performed integration tests with Clipper chips
manufactured
by the government's supplier,  Mykotronx  Inc., of Torrence, Calif., and is
preparing to integrate the chip into the manufacturing of its secure
products.
    AT&amp;T's Clipper-equipped telephone security devices will be available
to customers by the end of the second quarter.
    The federal government intends to adopt the Clipper chip as the
standard for voice encryption to help protect proprietary information,
protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent
unauthorized release of data transmitted electonically.  At the same
time, use of the Clipper chip will preserve the ability of federal,
state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone
conversations of criminals.
    "Adoption of Clipper will support both the government's efforts to
protect the public and the public's right to privacy," Hickey said.
    AT&amp;T Secure Communication Systems provides products to protect
voice, data, fax, cellular and video communications.  It also engineers
and integrates secure communications applications.  Its customers
include the governments of the United States and other nations as well
as major corporations around the world.
    AT&amp;T Secure Communications Systems is headquartered in Greensboro.
